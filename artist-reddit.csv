240;aiwars;12qxljv;On The Defensiveness of AI Artists;"tl;dr Because we want to feel that small spark of happiness from having created something without being shit on by people we have done no wrong to.

Something I have noticed as an AI art creator and a participant in AI art spaces is that we feel a sense of accomplishment and happiness that comes from having created something that didn't exist before. Even the most basic and simple AI creations can have this effect, particularly for people new to the community or to creative endeavors altogether. As someone who has little traditional skill in visual arts and limited time and talent to learn them, I feel a great deal of satisfaction in creating something that I set out to create. Sure, I can put in 'oil painting of a cat, greg rutkowski' and get something that brings a smile to my face but the real work of getting an image to match what is in my head, even when it is simplified by AI, feels like something real and worth sharing with others.

Much of the anger and defensiveness of the pro-AI community seems to come from being denied these simple pleasures. Some, of course, would take it too far and claim to be on par with a real artist whose skills have taken a lifetime to hone and who possesses a rare natural talent, but most of us aren't seeking that kind of recognition. I have found myself the target of barbed insults and personal attacks for sharing AI art creations that have resulted in real pain and depression, despite my rather tough and resilient ego, and these feelings are the root of extremism and factionalism. I've never sought any recognition as an artist or any money for my creations, all I seek is someone saying 'hey, that looks cool' and I am often treated as though I'm robbing my artistic heroes at gunpoint by people who seem to be lashing out at their helplessness to change the fact that AI art is here to stay and it makes cool images, usually better than what its critics can make. I'm not posting my creations in spaces like ""Hand-Made Paintings"", that would be an obvious problem that would justify a negative response, but in places that allow copy-paste of other peoples art and screenshots of tweets.

Ai art critics, and I would include myself among them in many ways, would do better to address real issues like whether pay services such as Midjourney should be forced to pay the artists whose work they are profiting from or supporting an opt-out for artists who do not want to be included in a pay sites database. We face the real possibility of both sides losing this fight and only mega-corporations being able to benefit from this technology while all commercial artists are replaced by computer simulations that regurgitate previous works.";66;18;0,74;2023-04-18 20:35:33;;https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/12qxljv/on_the_defensiveness_of_ai_artists/;mossmanjones;476;negative;artist;AI artist, bullied by anti-AI artist, pofit from pictures used in training dataset;;;
295;aiwars;10fxway;What would you said to artist who are just sad and sacred?;"English is not my first lenguaje, sorry for any mistake. 

I post this originally in r/defendingaiart but told me to better post here.

I think AI can be ethical, and don't belive that it should be destoyed, there's no coming back, I know it.

But I think that you're in the wrong for thinking its not a  replacement, if you work in a factory and every new tool that is put in your hands you call it a replacement you're wrong, but you wouldn't be wrong to call the first robot arm doing the exact same work as you a replacement. And I seen, not a lot but some of you mocking artists calling them money hungry, but if we wanted money we would never choose to be artists, you guys just need to go to choosingbeggars to read all the people calling artist lazy, that this isn't a real job, that all the hours and effort you put in your art should be free, that they wont pay an artist, etc, etc, etc. This was never a very profitable job, not even a recognized job, it's the job parents fear their childrend do, no one want to pay us or respect us, no one gives a fuck about artist way before AI art was a thing.

That's what makes me sad, people that didn't want to pay artist and treat them as the worst, now have everything they always wanted, a way to have art without dealing with the human beings that made art posible. 

This doesn't make me even angry, just sad, because it doesn't matter how much you compare this with photography this is not an alternative to art like it was photos, but a literal replacement. You guys are spending to much time acting like the mayority of artists are just trying to ban everything and being mean to poor ai artists, when most of us are just seeing our comisions go down and cant do anything besides feeling awful, usless.
A guy in the comments of a drawing I made said ""I can't wait for AI to get better than you"" and honestly, me neither.

339;aiwars;132mw9s;I don't really hear any of this getting discussed and I'm just tired of the same monotony;"Out of the gate, I will fully disclose for all personal bias that I am an artist pursuing an education, so if that helps contextualize where this sentiment comes from there ya go. This is more of a rant thread so I can just verbally scream into the void rather than an open invitation to debate so- lay into it lmao.

First and foremost, in relevance to art, my concern isn't that it's ethical or not. I like to do as little harm to others as I can throughout life, but I also don't consider myself an ethically good person. My clothes and product are made on the back of sweatshops, the meat I consume is harvested by horrific means. I am in no position to virtue signal others.

One thing I am tired of infinitely having to entertain in conversation with my programmer friends is the validity of what they're doing. Yes. It is art. People get stun-locked on this point like all art produced within the world is ephemeral and reaches towards divinity when that isn't the case at all. Don't get me wrong, I really do believe in the power of art, otherwise I wouldn't still be alive. I'm so fucking bored with the world that it's the only way I can contextualize it that gives it any amount of endearing characteristic anymore. Art can transcend and be representative of great thought, on numerous occasions I've witnessed it and it's completed shifted my position of something, reconceptualized the way I see the entirety of everything. But this is not a quality that is shared by all art. Art that is made by children is charming and endearing. Art made by beginners is encouraging and emboldening. Art by masters is profound. But this is where I have my problem, it was actually *made* by them. 

There's no doubt that you actually make your pictures by putting in prompts, editing them, even the more bold choosing to paint over it to try and get the ai to recognize what it is you want. But even in the most extreme cases, it's so lacking. Art is a paradox where to paraphrase the street artist painter duo Herakut, if you're thinking about what you're doing- you're doing it wrong. But at the same time each project, each creation is made by thousands of individual decisions. When I make a drawing and I choose what I want from it, I cannot emphasize the intimate level of management between gesture, contrast, light and form, in general the composition, and the way that this all gets entangled with what are referred to as the fundamentals of making art like perspective, anatomy, light and color, etc. When I am able to sit down in a gallery and earnestly look at a piece of abstract art and meditate on it for 10, 15 minutes, it doesn't really matter if it was made by a master or by a beginner, old man or child. Because that final picture is wholly theirs and theirs only. When I look at a painting I can identify individual thoughts and brush strokes, I can see the struggle, the joy, I can feel the environment that they immersed it in. I can feel what they felt successful in, and I can partly feel what they wish they had the skill to do- and it's so human. 

This is ultimately where I have a problem with ai art. It doesn't matter if by advancement of its models that it can eventually learn to trick me into thinking its an original work, because the sentiment is all the same. The moment I realize there was no actual thought put into it, my joy is taken away. Imagine your child coming to you on your birthday and handing you a card that they made for you, how much it means that they themselves made it, doesn't matter if it's shit or not, they made it with a purpose. When you try to measure the quality of ai art on the metric of whether or not it can trick someone into thinking it's a human work, you're running a fools errand. That's the moment where the teacher calls you and tells you that you're child didn't actually draw that birthday card for you, they stole it out of someone else's backpack. 

Hands be damned, fucked up anatomy, lack of consistent detail, motif, or compositional strength, the way I can always be certain I see an ai work before I check the tags is by whether or not it bores me to a level that I know that no human actually wanted it to exist.

I'm not trying to deprive anyone of their joy. I'm really not. If you want a pretty picture- please get one. Get your steampunk pretty woman art station KIKI+> whenever you want. If anything at a very basic level within the field of freelance artist's, ai art is a relief. As it means that no longer will you have some moron in your dm's telling you about his great idea for a game, and how he just needs you to do 60 hours of making assets for him for your name in the credits, or more commonly a 30 follower musician on Sound Cloud telling you that somehow it's your moral obligation to provide him an album cover. These are the lowest paying customers and I'll be happy if they can just find a means to an end without harassing some poor 14 year old on Twitter. 

If anyone is still hung-up on the ethical standing of it, it's time to grow up on both parts and accept what's happening. There's no need in playing coy if you're sampling 'Trevor Henderson Artstation trending soft shading no watermark' that you're literally just phoning it in over the labor of a living artist. I am sincerely tired of stumbling across the posts of some moron trying to sell prints of his ugly ai generated t-shirts, and seeing three lobotomites in their comments going *ERM ARE YOU OKAY WITH SCHTEALLIING THAT*. Yeah, they are, dumbass. 

And I'm so tired of the borrowed opinion of 'art=rich person tax write-off'. Yes, it happens. But I think you need to get your frontal cortex checked if you think that the person making concept art for a Blizzard game and getting fondled by their bosses are the same people selling some work called 'My Sadness' depicting a lonely immigrant child in front of an empty plate. The whole notion of artists somehow being monetarily incentivized is ironically rich considering how much of a notoriously pained path in life it is, and the fact that if I go onto Youtube at any given moment without an account and search 'AI art' all I get are people debating the ethical quandaries of it, seasoned amongst a swamp of what looks like failed attempts at The Thing to mimic either Vsauce or Elizabeth Holmes telling telling me how I can make 300k selling ai generated art. Now- I know this might be a controversial opinion. But if you thought that artists could at any moment make that much money by just dumping slop into a market, and that there existed an avenue to turn pictures into wealth on command, in the same world mind you where people choose to go blind or have teeth removed from their body because they can't afford the proper procedures, I think aside from a revolutionary shift in your mental faculties that you should never find yourself in a voting booth or giving another human being advice ever.  

This is a throwaway account. I'm not going to check back to debate comments or retaliate. I'll lay myself on the sword and assume that I've heard every worthwhile argument while talking to actual devs working with Hugging Face, enthusiasts of it, and consuming a mass amount of media in support of it.

415;aiwars;111t3v3;Having some doubts about AI art;"For several months, I've been generating thousands of images of art, and the experience has been thrilling, liberating, and has really gotten my creative juices flowing.  I'm even working in AI art into a project that I am doing by using it to create concept art, a project which does involve hiring a real artist for the final product.  I've firmly decided not to sell any of this art that I own, I believe that artists should be able to opt out of any AI programs, and I hate the atrocious behavior by some people who gone out of their way to disrespect artists, like the guy who took an artist's unfinished work, finished it using AI, then demanded that the real artist give them credit.  For a while, I've largely felt that the art community's reaction to any and all AI art has been hyperbolic and toxic, and I believe that AI generators when used in certain ways are legitimate tools.

However, after watching a certain video, my mind on AI art has slowly changed.  The video detailed how art generators in their current form are very damaging and exploitative to human artists.  The video's creator made an excellent point that every last bit of AI art comes from uncredited and uncompensated artists.  I cancelled my Midjourney subscription and am now even considering not using the generated art that I have made in my project as I can't definitively credit the artists off which the AI was inspired.  What is you guys' take on this?

BTW, the video I'm referring to is this (please don't harass them):

420;aiwars;103kdzu;Reasons why I'm completely Anti-AI Art and why I'm so against it.;"Over a past few weeks I've been seeing news articles about AI potentially stealing from artists and replacing them in the process.

Then I heard more information about artists being taunted by Techbros and being told ""Your art is so useless AI is possibly more art then what you've created.""

Specially all the talk on a few subreddits of AI defenders calling for artists to compensate these AI generators for protecting their work and all the talk about How artists should give up and let AI Replace us and take what we created which is why I'm so against AI.

I've seen some of my favorite artists leave because of this and it impacts me mentally considering I've known these artists since my youngest teen years, not only I've spent years of my life improving on my art but now that AI is here and everyone's forcing us to give up then I might is well just give up my talent and destroy whatever creation I have since I will be practically forced to give up the creations that I care about and the idea of my artistic talent being practically stripped from me is heart breaking to think about, Already my friends stopped drawing and already artists who are disabled and rely on commissions just to survive are already being impacted negatively and it's hard to wrap my head around why all of you are up for normalizing a horrible machine set to replace artists.


I Can't live in a society where Art is worthless and AI is considered real art, it's depressing to think about and the possible creations owned by their original creators now owned by AI and the individual who never even created them, I Spent years creating things I love but now that AI is here to take that away from me I don't know what identity i have now considering AI practically took what I loves away from me.


As we know it human creation now belongs to AI, Now artists are forced to give up their creations and I hate that to happen but with much brain washing and being told my art isn't worth shit then why am I am artist? 

Why did I get inspired just to pick up a pencil and draw?

Why did I start drawing since I was nine years old?

What am I now? I'm practically no one considering AI has already replace us.

466;ArtistLounge;13c1qk6;AI art has ruined Art Station;"I used to love this site. I've logged in almost daily since I took upon myself becoming an artist, specifically concept artist or illustrator. It used to be an amazing site, where you could see the pros and aspiring artist grow, and get tons of inspiration and ideas. That is all gone now.

Now I enter the site, and the first thing i see is a big square with a clearly AI generated generic pretty anime/stylized girl, which suspiciously looks like the style of an already stablished artist, but strangely enough, its not the artist himself who posted this? 

Next thing you realize, people are selling AI generated reference and other stuff, which i find mind boggling, but even more so that there are people that buy it. And even more mind/boggling so that a site as big as Art Station allows this.

Best of all, they claim to have taken ""measures"" against ai art to ""protect"" artists. What a bombastic, huge, humoungous amount of crap. i don't know what exactly happened, but there is probably some suitcase passing behind the scenes. This ""measure"" is putting a check box in the filters, which you will have to look hard for it, because it's at the bottommost of the list. Only the decision to put it there says a lot. People made this page, nothing is placed somewhere out of randomness or laziness.

And this doesnt even filter out a lot of the ai generated content, because the artist himself has to state the fact that he used it in the program list. Which AI artist in their sane mind would put it there?? It's like automatically blacklisting yourself. This measure is beyond useless.

The part that makes me sad the most, is that now i just don't go to this site anymore. It's practically impossible to tell what is AI generated and what is not. And there are cases of normal artists getting flak for supposedly using it, and viceversa.

ArtStation is the portfolio site. It's ment to gauge the skill of the artists, not blow up like instagram or tiktok. It's ment for pros looking for fresh hires and upcoming artists.

I cannot give up on making art, but the rise of image generators... it seems like the majority favor mass production and quantity instead of emotion and quality.

So... Is that it? Is it over? When I learn well, will it stop there? I can't give up... but it seems life is trying its best to make me do so... it's also trying its best to replace humans...

528;ArtistLounge;10ey4pl;I've got no other job option than art because of my disability. Now AI art makes me think I should just give up.;"People will always want something fast, free and automated. It's cruel when factory workers are put out of their jobs and homes because of automation, it's cruel for corporate employees, but artists? It's completely fine. 

Everyone consumes art, its their shows, their phone background, their mugs and their furniture. Yet artists themselves are still so stigmatised and taken advantage of. Reposts without credit, tracing, AI. How am I supposed to live when art isn't seen as something to be respected, but consumed like an endless banquet when artists are human and have limits. In the animation industry the crunch time is inhumane, if they could put us to slave labour they would, as well as any job out there. But for artists it doesn't matter, because everyone wants art, but they don't wanna spend on something that has been funnelled down their throats seemingly for almost free for the last 2 decades (Netflix subscriptions etc).

It'd not just an art problem, it's a capitalism problem, amazon, shien, everything is made to be cheap and fast, even at the expense of people being worked to death. Would they look a factory worker in the eye, who is given less than a living wage with multiple jobs and say ""so what. If I want it I can have it. Stop being so entitled.""? But it's okay to say it to me when I'm 17 with a dead mom and am facing homelessness. Because I'm an artist. Because people are just saying ""art isn't a real job"" in more words, with more exploitative resources.

I can't do this anymore, it's heartbreaking to think that I'm not the only one, people of so many ages and professions are getting fucked over and falling under the heel of capitalism.

554;ArtistLounge;12r0fye;Friends Started Using AI;"I'm curious if anyone else is experiencing this. Do you have friends who you don't just not like what they're making, but you don't respect that they're making it? Doesn't have to be AI related.

I have a couple of friends and family who have started to generate images with AI a lot.

One of these friends is calling it their art and they've started to promote it. They think the reason artists don't like AI is because we're afraid of it. They also think there's nothing unethical about it and AI is a new medium.

Another friend has started using it in stuff they sell on Etsy. They think artists just need to accept it.

I've talked to them about my reservations about AI, but they disagree. Both of them consider themselves to be artists. I think they don't want to put in effort to learn skills and make things themselves.

I don't want to ruin friendships over this or be a discouraging friend, but it's started to make me respect them less overall. What they're doing feels fake to me. Starting to feel like I don't even want to talk to them.

Edit: Wow thanks for all the great discussions, it was really thought-provoking, validating, and challenging all at once.

556;ArtistLounge;x1wjak;Joined a DTIYS and I’m sort of upset that an ai art piece was entered;"I don’t know if I’m just being silly, but I entered a DTIYS (draw this in your style) and somebody entered with an ai piece and it’s just kind of annoying because they’re getting so many comments about how they’re so talented, the art is beautiful etc etc, the host of the Dtiys reposted the piece to their instagram story and complimented it.

And it’s just kind of annoying that I spent 3 hours on my piece and not only is it way uglier than the ai entry, but people appreciate and love the ai version more than most of the actually drawn entries. I don’t care about all the entries that are better than mine because I know I’m still learning and I can appreciate the work and skill that has gone into each piece, but this ai piece has just annoyed me because it’s so much better than anything I could ever produce, and people seem to love and appreciate it even though it’s Ai made.

This probably comes across as bitter and jealous and yea, I am a bit bitter and jealous lol.

559;ArtistLounge;x2r016;AI Art will indeed kill a lot of jobs, and is our own fault;"do you guys stand another AI related Post? as someone with skin on both sides, (i have a STEM degree and a Graphic Design degree) i think AI art willl further alienate digital artists, and will increase the value of traditional ones

for the last decades, traditional art (oil, canvas, charcoal, pencil etc) was but relegated to hobbysts, fine art and at most early stages of storyboarding and drafts, the digital art pipelines was absolute from bottom to finish, to the point that many younger artists didn't even bother to learn traditional skills and jumped directly to digital art, Sonic OC character first, still life studies later, sh\*tt anime drawing first, andrew loomis later.

as someone who is not as young anymore, i can say with confidence that the general public never really accepted digital art as ""ART"", they see a photoshop tab, they see a computer, its cheating in their eyes, and now they have the validation that they wanted, all the time we said how you needed to learn the fundamentals, how it was the same thing as traditional drawing, now an AI can do it, and lets be honest, can do it better than most of us.

and i guarantee you, the public will be more than happy to replace you and your little wacom for some singapore ai art farm, and laugh at your face for pursuing an ""useless degree"" and not making real art (do you even know how to draw a realistic sketch of iron man on tik tok?! ), don't think people will defend ""human art"" ,they will defend as much as they defend fair labor and wages on the sweat shops of china for their shiny smartphones

the rendering wars i called, from most of youtube channels to subreddits, who can render the most perfect skin, the most cliche semi realistic anime waifu lips, the most perfect hair, the pinacle of skill, we digged our own graves, who won the rendering wars? a freaking machine

AI art will over saturate the market, as much as your sh\*tty 2010's dubstep, and the higher art and graphic designer positions will require proof of traditional art skills and know how, the entry level market will all just disappear, the floor for an art career will become considerably higher, and when your typical ""Hustle culture"" influencer start posting ""tutorials"" on how to stack clients with AI art on Fiverr and Upwork, and all the online portfolios looks like a mismatched outbreak of surrealistic anime girls painted as impressionist paintings, maybe then, your average andrew loomis, by the book artist with some traditional knowledge who knows his ways on the basic disciplines, and is not just a rendering machine looking on how to paint the mostly realistic waifu lips, maybe then this kind of artist will have a little more value again, a work horse, not a show ponny.

i always enjoyed the ""Bob ross"" style of painting, simple, a simple portrait, a simple expression of a feeling, a moment of time, something unique

but AI art reflects the nature of the art community and overall taste of people in art, it is always something moronic as ""CyBeRpUNK GoThAMcItY"", always an explosion of unecessary detail, a punch of surrealistic BS, hyper realistic rendering to overflown your senses as much as an hyper sugar coated soda or soft drink, we got art diabetes, every ai generated image makes me wanna throw up, its the conclusion of years of bad habits of the art community, everytime you liked that samurai darth vader rendering, or the realistic gothic disney princessess, yup, thats for you

if anything positive comes out of this, is an end to the rendering wars, who can paint the most realistic stylized anime BS

if you want to consideer a career in art, be in technical art, animation, texture painting, become a highly skill professional, learn some programming, your etsy page will not keep it up with technology

My main concern with AI art is how it’s going to affect freelancers and people who do commissions. Especially people who do anime character commissions. Because looking at waifu diffusion, a anime AI generator, it’s really good at making anime characters.

Funnily during this time, AI Art became extremely prevelant in especially creepy/dystopian art subreddits (Midjourney) and to see that anybody can just give a prompt and it ""paints"" something that I probably wouldn't be skilled enough to do in years to come is honestly discouraging.

644;ArtistLounge;x4c72z;AI vs other art forms (a comment);"Another AI post, very tiring I know, but I wrote this as a response to a post that ended up being a troll post and I wanted to share here so people can read through my thoughts on major differences and/or harm that AI (mainly those not labeling and the people behind the pieces not the pieces themselves)  is currently bringing. 

The troll was saying they were an AI artist who worked to master the prompt writing for better images, for some context.

---

The main difference is that when people see art work they're expecting that it's created by your own hand and physical drawing/painting abilities. Thats why they're willing to pay as much as art costs, because it's created using years of built up skill and takes hours or days to create.

Mastering a prompt is not the same as the physical toll it takes to create the piece by hand. Now, I say this as a writer who's used prompts for writing and done writing without it. There is an EXTREME difference between being the sole input (idea, typing/painting/drawing) for a piece than having the idea and being aided in making the piece via a fully computer generated image.

I'm not saying it doesn't have its uses, I've used things like Artbreeder for characters (I have the same face syndrome) and I plan on using it to help with my pieces in the future because i csnnot visualize, but I'm NEVER going to try and pass off the AI image as though I made it myself by my hand. THATs why the tag; I also tag pieces I painted from an image (as in the traced shapes of a reference image that I painted the colors) because whenever I look at art, my first assumption is that it's 100% made from scratch- it may have a reference, but no tracing or photo bashing.

It's annoying that AI artist on sites like fivver, meant for up and coming artists/ cheaper freelancers are being flooded with AI/photo bashing without the tags stating that they are, because those buying them think they're actually works that are being painted by hand- which is essentially lying and conning clients, sometimes for exhorbanent amounts of money (think 100+) for something that can take only a few seconds to make with only minimal (under 3 months) training to learn.

I mean look at Jazza. A number of those high cost works were AI and he paid upwards of $100, probably about $500 for works he could have entered the prompts for and gotten better results.

Now I love art pieces, but theres a limit. Unless it's an original commission and I can make edits and see the process, I'm not going to pay more than a photo print price (think 10-25 depending in size) for an artwork unless it's the physical original piece.

People are paying because they don't realize how it was made. I know I didn't know about AI (beyond art breeder) and how it was cranking out full images until about a month ago and I'm an artist myself. I'm 1000% sure that my family, who aren't artists and are the type of people that would be possible clients DONT know AI art is a thing and assume they're supporting an artist who is working hours and hours per piece to refine and make it as nice as they can.


I definitely don't have anything against AI art as a whole, but it is a new and separate branch of art that does need to be labeled and defined. Same as how digital is labeled different from traditional. (And yes it's different from digital because the digital we mean is the computer art programs, while AI is what people think that ALL digital art is.)
My only issue is those who are trying to pass entering a prompt as hours and hours of work per piece by not saying it's AI art, making unrealistic expectations for buyers when it comes to artists who actually are creating pieces majorly or fully by their own hand. This is one of those ""bad egg"" situations and I definitely feel for those who are being dragged unjustly and aren't asking huge prices becuase they're getting lumped in with the ""quick money"" people sadly.";28;0;0,41;2022-09-02 23:55:00;Discussion;https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/x4c72z/ai_vs_other_art_forms_a_comment/;throwaway-clonewars;709;negative;artist;AI artist claiming art by them and sell it;;;

I love my art style, and would not want to change it, but I am very concerned about the effects my art style will have on my professional career.

I recently found out about AI generated art so i tried it out. I had an idea about a drawing for years in which a horse race is happening on the moon and everyone is wearing space helmets. I typed it into Midjourney and it gave me a painting in 20 seconds which was better than anything I could have ever created. So I'm kinda scared and I'm doubting my choice of learning art. What is it worth if I invest hundreds or thousands of hours to learn how to draw and I can't even make money from my skill because AI can create better art in 4 seconds than I can in four hours.

In the early 19th century the use of the photograph was probably very threatening to artists. But some painters like James Abagnail Whistler recognized that the camera was the superior artist in terms of realism and the role of the painter was to create views that a camera could not. So now with AI programs like Dall-E and Midjourney that, just like ordering a pizza online and listing your toppings, you can create an artistic masterpiece. We like to see other humans excel, and we also like fast and cheap – which is why this may feel very threatening – because with visual art and graphics, there’s nothing performative, the art is truly separate from the artist, there’s no need for you and with highly polished graphics or artwork, the techniques, the errors, the artistic processes are all sanitized out and all you’re left with is the end product. And if it’s just the end product that matters, then the craft and expression and inspiration cease to matter and perhaps imposes the idea that art, the one bastion of individuality and spiritual uniqueness is nothing but a few tag phrases.";5;0;0,41;2022-08-11 05:26:58;Discussion;https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/wlfwc6/ai_and_art/;MassiveReign;198;negative;artist;AI threaten artist bcs art is valued only at the end;;;

I am writing this post to free this thought from my mind, I am at the final stage of grief.

do u guys hate artists, more specifically, do u disrespect them in any way? like cmon on man, I spent hours and hours to atleast mid at what I draw, thats gotta account for something right?

to me AI art is like driving an automatic, I would 100% choose a manual car, not bc of any elitism, but bc I like to drive a manual, even its a pain in the ass sometimes.

idc about people who drive automatics, you're not into that, I get it, you just wanna go from A to B, thats why you bought a car to begin with, all power to you.

I enjoy bragging rights, I enjoy feeling gratification for things I have put effort into.

I wanna have control of every line, I wanna pour my heart and soul into every sketch, I want the colors to bleed, and I want the image to mean something for anyone who looks for more than 5 seconds at it. 

I have completely lost my drive once I saw AI art discourse, its almost like half the people talking dont have any type of empathy.

for the past couple of months I have started to get more and more defeated, like why do I even draw anymore.

I am just tired man. the world just keeps getting duller and duller everyday. I just wanna be happy for once.

54;DefendingAIArt;1077hnl;"Introducing a new term for a specific type of ""AI Artist""";"I just want to start with saying that I've seen people use Stable Diffusion as a plugin in Photoshop or GIMP and continuously switch back and forth between using Stable Diffusion as a brush and using all the other parts of Photoshop or GIMP to make a picture, working in tandem and using the AI as an assistant. These people \*are\* artists and I don't want to take that away from them whatsoever. 

I was watching the episode of The Simpsons where Marge gets addicted to gambling and Homer refers to her as a ""slot jockey"". As soon as I heard this term, I figured **PROMPT JOCKEY** is probably a good descriptor for what I'm doing. 

Merriam-Webster defines the noun version of the word ""jockey"" in the second slot as ""a person who operates or works with a specified vehicle, device, object, or material"" with examples: ""a bus jockey"" and ""pencil jockeys""

I think this really fits. While recognizing that some use Stable Diffusion as a tool in their artistic workflow and those people are definitely not ""jockeys"", most of us do not much more than operate or work with an image generating model or several generating models by requesting that it create the art for us using specific prompts 

I will definitely label myself as a prompt jockey because I don't feel like I'm an artist and I'll continue to do so until I hear of a better term";38;31;0,73;2023-01-09 08:57:16;;https://www.reddit.com/r/DefendingAIArt/comments/1077hnl/introducing_a_new_term_for_a_specific_type_of_ai/;nebetsu;239;neutral;artist;prompt jockey, redefining ai artist;;;

-

so.. the ones that will get weeded out are the newer artists that have not as much experience, right? but then, where do ***we*** come in?

is it possible for us sole AI Artists to replace them if non-AI-artists could just learn AI as fast as we could (once they have no choice but to use them) ?

so in the end, wouldn't it just be AI Tools (used by their lead / senior artists) that replace tons of the not-so-good artists, instead of us?

Then out would come a fully colored sequence of frames.

As for the training... Let's say that the training data would be in parts. One part would be the uncolored animation sequence, the other would be the same sequence after being properly colored by humans, and there would also be the color design sheets for the sequence. There would be thousands or millions of these in the database (depending on how much they were able to acquire).

And let's assume that the users of this tool still have to do a correctional check over each AI colored frame, so as to manage errors, and that the training data is acquired legally and officially.

It doesn't paint a very nice picture of people who defend AI art if they have no human decency and no insight into the process of making art.

Using the likeness would be specifying their name in a prompt to fish out a style which I assume you're all aware works, or using a checkpoint or LoRA or embedding or whatever additional methods there are to achieve a particular style of art.

237;aiwars;13448r7;I'm a comic artist - How might my future look like?;"Hey there! I'm neither strongly Pro nor Anti AI, but I'm very curious as to how this developing technology could affect my career as well as for other comic artists.

A bit about me: I'm a comic artist who works part time for now, but am slowly growing my income to try to make it full time. I've had a lot of experience in both art and comp sci, but I've chosen to go with art because while it's more unreliable, it's personally the more enjoyable out of the two. If my art career becomes irrelevant, I can always go into a different field and while I'd be saddened to lose a great career, I'd still like a career in the field of computer science. I find AI art to be fascinating and a great tool to use for brainstorming and for fun. I'm still unsure about the ethicality of it, but regardless it's likely going to stay for the future.

Personally, I think that unlike illustration, comic artists have a lot more likely chance of not being largely replaced due to the need for comics to look constantly consistent in its overall style. I've even tried an experiment of incorporating the AI into my workflow, but honestly it didn't help that much other than with the background. But even with the background, I found it much easier to create most of it from scratch! Of course, that's not to say that no AI comics will exist in the future. I've seen it done a few times and sometimes it looks bad, but sometimes it looks very well made.

A realization I've made that I haven't heard many people say before about art is that after a certain point of skill, the quality doesn't matter as much as the concept. The main reason that people follow my art accounts because they like my unique ideas. I'm thinking that perhaps it's because of the fact that I have those unique ideas + a unique style that my career may be able to last for the forseeable future.

Anyways, there's a lot of interesting people on this subreddit and I'm very curious to hear about what people think about how the future might be like for people like me.

Artist here, I used to be a lot more negative towards AI art, but I've warmed up to the tech somewhat and now consider myself neutral-to-cautiously-optimistic. I think it can open a lot of new creative pathways for people and act as a powerful tool for artists. I'm still wary of the potential for exploitation (such as artists being laid off because AI is cheaper and companies want to cut costs), but that's more of an issue with late-stage capitalism than the tech itself.

My question for both sides: would you consider a future where the stigma against AI art is removed *but* it's considered a third category of art alongside digital/traditional art a good (or ideal) one? Just like how an oil painting, a photograph and a digital illustration all have different unique qualities but are still considered art, I think a lot of the fears around AI art would be lessened if it was widely treated not as a direct competitor to digital artists, but a different medium with a different creative process. (I'm talking about primarily AI-generated works. Just like artists inking in pencil then coloring digitally, I'd consider digital artists making substantial use of AI in their creative process mixed media artists.)

I'm aware that with the current state of the AI debate we can't achieve this for now, but I'm curious whether people would be happy with this view of AI art if there were no stigma around labeling it as such.

446;aiwars;1095fx2;High level thoughts on the debate from a creative professional NOT opposed to AI;"I’m a creative professional and artist/musician/writer on the side. I’ve been researching and working on a long-form essay about why I’m NOT opposed to AI. The arguments I've heard against it so far seem weak, disingenuous or misguided. My thoughts have been running along the lines listed below. Admittedly, it’s a very high-level perspective rather than trying to argue over disputed details, but I’m curious what both sides think of this since I’d like to develop it further.

1. AI art opponents seek to use copyright--intellectual property rights--to prevent progress for their own economic benefit, but the overarching purpose of copyright is to promote progress, not hinder it or stop it. Copyright is intentionally limited, and is not an absolute right in perpetuity. Whether or not a specific company or artist using generative AI has infringed another artist's copyright is an unsettled question. Both sides of the debate need to be up front about that. To get a precedent, an artist would need to bring a strong lawsuit and likely get it up to the Supreme Court, which would take years. For reference, the recent Goldsmith v. Warhol lawsuit that was argued before SCOTUS last October began in 2017. IP lawyer Megan Noh believes filing an AI art lawsuit would be ""an uphill battle."" ([https://news.artnet.com/art-world/artificial-intelligence-illustration-spawning-2195919](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/artificial-intelligence-illustration-spawning-2195919))
2. AI art opponents seem to gloss over the history of art, how copying and recombination are key components of the creative process. Artists have always copied other artists, “stolen from them,” have always directly appropriated the work of other artists. ([https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/appropriation](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/appropriation))
3. AI art opponents seem to be against machine learning in general, but machine learning is just an extension of human learning. It's a tool. Humans are behind the code. Humans are the ones using the machines. If machine learning based off of publicly available data is wrong, then so is human learning. ([https://texaslawreview.org/fair-learning/](https://texaslawreview.org/fair-learning/))
4. Some commercial artists have used disingenuous arguments, and sometimes outright lies, about what generative AI technology does. This is actually harmful to the cause of trying to help artists through this transition. For an example, see Karla Ortiz's Go Fund Me campaign. [https://www.gofundme.com/f/protecting-artists-from-ai-technologies](https://www.gofundme.com/f/protecting-artists-from-ai-technologies)
5. AI art opponents focus so narrowly on art that they miss the bigger picture, the larger transformation in society that AI is bringing. AI has the potential to be like electricity as futurist and AI expert Martin Ford says ([https://www.futureofbusinessandtech.com/business-ai/futurist-martin-ford-on-the-danger-of-ai/](https://www.futureofbusinessandtech.com/business-ai/futurist-martin-ford-on-the-danger-of-ai/)). It’s a revolution in how we will address all kinds of problems from medical diagnosis to combating climate change, and nations are currently in a race to see who will dominate on the world stage. Our focus shouldn’t be on preserving the influence and status that one economic group currently has (artists), but on how society can restructure so that everyone can come to benefit.";56;35;0,97;2023-01-11 16:02:02;;https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/1095fx2/high_level_thoughts_on_the_debate_from_a_creative/;Me8aMau5;456;neutral;artist;condemn anti AI, copyright is to promote progress, anti AI gloss over history, anti Ais just hate ML in general, anti AI spred lies and missinformation;;;

464;ArtistLounge;y3jqi9;How could a real Artist make use of AI generated art in the right way?;"I believe it is completely right for a so called artist to make use of AI generated art as reference for what someone wants to draw.

 Since as far as I know, AI generated art by text prompt is unique and non-repeatable, and even if it were, I still believe it is right.

Unless of course you’re taking it as real art, at least real human art and even saying it is yours.

I had this discussion with my uncle Vinnie the other night and he said something like.

“The AI apparently gathers info from different sources and styles and these ‘sources and styles’ are from known to unknown artists in the internet and that’s probably why some AI generated art looks so similar to drawings and style from other artists”.

So in the way that my uncle Vinnie puts it, does this mean that even if you use AI generated art as a pure reference, would you be unintentionally copying from other artist’s drawing which happens to be similar from the one that the AI gave you?.

With my art, I would say I'm kind of creative and really inspired to try something new. I have ideas that I want to put on paper, I plan on trying a different art style. I want to make webcomics with meaningful messages (You might call it activism, but I'm pretty neutral in these aspects), but also funny comics, with a Classic Simpson-y sense of humour, as it has been a big source of inspiration for me in my adult years.

I keep hearing that it is a tool, but I fail to see how an artist can introduce it into their worflow in ways normies could not.  In which ways do you think an artist that already has their fundamentals down can make use of this technology? References? Not really, they are not good reference material for any complex poses. And the poses that do come out right are already out there on the internet and are easy to find (Like, just a person sitting or leaning forwards). To render the work for you? Ehhh, that only is useful if your style was already close to what the prompts offer, or if you train a model with your own art, but then it is still not usefull for people that don't have a consistent style.

Some of the goals they want to achieve:

* Updating IP and data privacy laws to address this new technology
* Requiring AI companies to adhere to a strict code of ethics, as advocated by leading AI Ethics organizations.
* Governments hold Stability AI accountable for knowingly releasing irresponsible Open Source models with no protections to the public.

And a little of their vision for the future:

* Ensure that all AI/ML models that specializes in visual works, audio works, film works, likenesses, etc. utilizes public domain content or legally purchased photo stock sets. This could potentially mean current companies shift, even destroy their current models, to the public domain.
* Urgently remove all artist’s work from data sets and latent spaces, via algorithmic disgorgement. Immediately shift plans to public domain models, so Opt-in becomes the standard.

I haven't listed everything, so please go check out their page.

I think this is just what we have been waiting for. Finally someone will start to ask for regulations.

544;ArtistLounge;118dibh;Anyone else changing their approach to art because of the rise of AI?;"In response to the rise of ""AI art"" I have been going through a major shift in my art and the way I think about art. Are any of you going through a similar thing? 

For years, my goal was to make technically beautiful images. I wanted my art to be perfect, to realistically represent things that didn't exist, to be aesthetically pleasing, to make something people looked at and went, ""wow, that's skillfully done, perfect!"". However, with the rise of ai, I have lost interest in that. 

Ai can, in mere seconds, make images more technically realistic and ""aesthetically pleasing"" than something that would take me a week. And realizing that I didn't LIKE those images was MINDBLOWING. It made me feel that what mattered wasn't how ""good"" something looked or how realistic it was but how well it communicated a feeling, how I felt the artist's hand, and what it was saying. I stopped caring about how a piece of art looked and started thinking about how it made me feel.

Since then, I've stopped with my endless quest towards ""beautiful realism"" and have been trying to get more expressive with my art. I'm allowing myself to get sloppy in exchange for being more emotive. I am trying to say more. I've been researching artistic movements that I once laughed off (I LIKE abstract expressionism now?????). And honestly, I've been making way better work since I changed my thoughts about it!  People react to it better, and weirdly, It's even more aesthetically pleasing, even though that wasn't my goal! Overall I've gotten a lot more ""artsy""

584;ArtistLounge;y9zka8;Unclear morality of using AI art as reference?;"Background: I'm generally out of the loop, but I recently saw a meme about AI art. I knew little of it before hand. That led to some light research, and I was pretty surprised by what it could spit out. Then I started to feel kind of... sad, or maybe uncomfortable? Like if I wanted to make something, I could mull it over for a couple hours or a few days. But a few hundred lines of code can completely mimic, and potentially even surpass my human creativity within a matter of seconds. It's a strange feeling. 

With that I also started to wonder - Is it morally wrong to use AI art as reference for your own work? Let me be clear, I 100% agree that passing purely AI generated art as your own is only for talentless hacks. But where is the line? What if I were to generate something and then use physical media to recreate it? What if I only use a portion of it? As far as I know it's entirely untraceable.

590;ArtistLounge;wddpal;"What can we as artists do that AI can't (for now at least)? Wanting to focus on strengthening the ""human skills"" and looking for ideas.";"I know there's been a lot of posts about these AI's and the art that can be made through them. And I personally am someone that keeps bouncing between the thought of ""Well, fast fashion didn't end the craft of knitting and sewing, those people still have their own customer base, why should this be any different?"" and the more chaotic state of ""Oh no, I really wanted to do concept art as a job, have I really messed up with this direction and what if the AI really will take over everything"".   


And seeing the recent trend of amazing AI art, it is difficult to not feel this way, but what I want to do instead is focus on what I can do that an AI can't do just yet, how to I hone in on the skills that only a human can do? The connection with the art, the client. Storytelling, creativity.   


But I have no idea where to start just yet, so I figured, why not come here and ask for some ideas? And maybe it could also help ease some of the worries of other fellow artists in here?   


And I know it's annoying with the same posts over and over again, fear of AI and all - but maybe this could work as sort of an antidote to those fears? For now atleast.

I've been thinking this morning... Is there any ways to protect our art from being used by Ai ? Is it even worth it to protect them ? 

Would it be a great idea to create a place where artist can post their art, without fearing they might be used by AI ? ( Not allowed to screen, save, be used). 
Is it even feasible? 
It looks very difficult to create such a place. I supposed somebody would have done it a long time ago already.

To be short : do you think we should protect ourselves from Ai by creating something that counters his algorithm, or should we just move on ?

604;ArtistLounge;xy6xfh;AI Art is still art, even if you’re not a fan of it.;"I’ve been seeing this topic all over my socials and I feel like giving an alternative viewpoint. Not to argue but to discuss.

And to preface I’m not an ai-artist. I draw with a Wacom pen. Just so you know I’m coming from an unbiased perspective.

In case you’re unaware, AI art has become quite the hot button issue among various art communities as of late, with the general consensus being that it’s not “real art”.

Which I personally find snobbish. The beauty of art is that calling something art *makes* it art. There are countless examples which challenge what it means to *be* art and are *still* considered art. [Banana taped to a wall?](https://news.artnet.com/market/maurizio-cattelan-banana-art-basel-miami-beach-1722516/amp-page) Art. [Urinal with a signature?](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp)) Art. [Literally nothing?](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/italian-artist-auctioned-off-invisible-sculpture-18300-literally-made-nothing-1976181/amp-page) Art.

Ok so art has no physical meaning, so could it be the intention by a human being to create art which separates art from *not* art? Well AI art would still be count. The AI doesn’t create the art out of nowhere it requires hours of input and tweaking from a person who **intended** to create AI art. Even then, sometimes unintentional art can happen. But that’s a debate for another time.

If it’s the sampling from other artists which no longer makes it art, ai art would still count. Not just from the fact sampling is very prominent in art such as collage, music, and photography; But also because the ai doesn’t sample. It creates its own art and compares it to thousands of examples with the same keywords to see how well it did. Not one pixel is cropped from an existing piece.

This debate on what “real art” is has been going on since forever and it’s always been a fruitless fight. Gatekeeping art has never once worked, try finding an example of it ever working in history. (Seriously I want to know that could be interesting.)

I know the animosity comes from the fear of AI taking jobs away from artists, which I’m concerned for too don’t get me wrong. I myself am an animator and I don’t want to be replaced by an AI!

But even with those concerns, it’s still art in my opinion. Art can be anything, including a threat to career prospects. I feel gatekeeping art -even art we don’t like- isn’t the right way to go about these concerns.

If you don’t agree with me, that’s completely fine. My reasoning is subjective. Just please respect people who see it differently. I’ve seen some people online take things too far and wish death on them, which even if you hate ai art you have to agree that’s unacceptable.

I apologize if this comes across as heated that’s not my intention. Sometimes the things I write read differently than how they sound in my head. You know how it is.";25;3;0,54;2022-10-07 21:47:12;Discussion;https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/xy6xfh/ai_art_is_still_art_even_if_youre_not_a_fan_of_it/;Camacaw2;461;neutral;artist;question about ai art real art;;;

So first thing i want to say when i started drawing i was told many many times that drawing is not about money or being better then someone else it's about being able to draw what you want being able to get your ideas out and relax. However i feel like many have forgot that how you learn to draw for yourself first am i wrong thinking that way?

And lastly and this is a issue i have with many artists how is the AI stealing art from what i understand it looks at many references and makes something based off of them issue is......I was told that's how most people draw new stuff they look at  references and make stuff based off what they see and knowledge of how art works.....and if so are most artists not also ""stealing art""

But I feel like the hype hasn't died out as much as I thought it would, and I'm starting to doubt that an AI can't be taught creativity

People are saying ""traditional art is safe"", but what if I don't want to paint on a canvas? I'm in art school and I feel like by the time I get out It'll be even harder to break into the game art industry than before the AI. In it's current state I think AI isn't viable as a replacement, but in a few years it might be considering how fast it's developing...

There probably will be companies that use AI for character/weapon/costume/etc design, if there aren't some already. Maybe AI will actually replace many artists and only the best ones in the industry will stay? But I feel like by then, even if you are really good and have a nice portfolio companies will think it's a gamble and won't easily employ a new face.

I read that AI art can't be copyrighted but how's that stopping it from being used?

I guess this is kind of a rant. Sorry for another AI post, I just feel like I'm having an existential crisis. Doesn't have to be just game art related, that's just the closest thing to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**INTRODUCTION**

&#x200B;

For the ones that don't know it, the last months/years there has been a great increase in what is known as *""AI-Art""*.

AI-Art usually consists in a program with Artificial Intelligence at the core of it, that allows users to write sentences (or prompts) and later renders images that match (to some extent) the descriptions in those sentences. The images rendered by these programs with Artificial Intelligence can have different styles, themes and levels of realism depending on the sentences/actions made by the users and the program used. Sometimes, during the process of rendering an image, these programs will provide users with different outputs or images created, and the user will be able to select the one that they want, and then the program will provide the user with different outputs resembling the image chosen... and the process repeats itself.

As an example, you could put into an AI-Art program the following description: *""A cartoony, sad cactus playing a violin in the top of a realistic snowen mountain while cartoony snowmen laugh at him at the base of the mountain""*. And it would return you one or multiple images that match this description.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**THE PROBLEM**

&#x200B;

The recent creation of AI-Art and the increase in demand of it, have led to many traditional and digital artists to be angered, scared, sad and frustrated with AI-Art due to the main following reasons:

* **Fear of unemployment, less amount of job opportunities and lower salaries.** The fact that some AI programs can already generate images in a few seconds/minutes capable of impressing the average person and for free (or paying a cheap monthly fee), has caused lots of worry to many tradtional and digital professionals who create Art. Such as: ilustrators, concept artists, freelance artists, logo and corporative design artists, character design artists... Maybe even some traditional painters.
* **Stolen content.** Since the AI programs that create these images has been trained or metaphorically feed with traditional or digital Art made by many artists, some people view AI-Art as a type of theft and attack against intellectual property; a new type of plagiarism. Other people disagree on this point since they argue that the majority of artists are inspired and learn by looking at the Art from other artists and that condemning AI-Art for this reason would be a double-standard.
* **Menace to art quality and culture.** Some people have problems with AI-Art because they see it as meaningless, nihilistic, absurd and lacking emotions, message and story. They also might have problems with the way that AI-Art looks, since it sometimes has some anatomical deformities and big ""errors"" (I don't think they are purposeful) at the little details. Finally, they might also think that since this art relies very heavily on AI and little on the person who made the prompts, it lacks the soul of an artist. All this reasons have made some artists or Art-enjoyers to see AI-Art as a threat to high quality Art and culture.
* **Lack of motivation and impotence.** AI-Art can make some artists demotivated and unhappy with their Art creations. At the end of the day, my opinion (I might be wrong) is that many artists (hobbists or professionals) are not able to make pieces of art that look so stunning as the ones made by an AI. That is NOT to say that AI-Art is better, but to say that it's usually more stunning to the average person than a traditional or digitally crafted piece of art. This can make the competition between traditional/digital artists and AI-artists to seem extremely unfair and threatening. Especillay, when we take into account that a person without Art experience can create a more impressive-looking image in a few minutes than the image created in one week by a traditional or digital artist with with 10 years of Art experience (depending on each artist, of course).

All these reasons (and maybe some more), have created a profound atmosphere of hostility and rage between a high (not all) number of traditional/digital artists and AI artists. And it has lead to a very remarkable question: *""If someone uses an AI-Art program to render an image... have they created the Art themselves or the computer made the Art?""*.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**MY REFLEXION**

&#x200B;

Let's imagine the following scenario, with the following people: Mathew and Nadia.

Mathew considers themselves an AI artists and spends some of his time rendering images using AI. He comes up with ideas and tells the AI how to execute them either by writting descriptions/prompts or guiding the AI by clicking on its possible outputs (mentioned in the Introduction), or both ways.

Nadia considers themselves a traditional artist and spends some of her time rendering images using physical paint and physical canvases. She comes up with her own ideas and she buys the materials needed to create them, such as brushes, pigments, canvases, acrylic, rules, compases, graphite, duck tape...

Then, one day, Matthew and Nadia accidentally meet in an Art Gallery and start conversating with each other. But few minutes later the following happens...

1. Matthew tells Nadia that he is an AI artist and that he creates Art with AI.
2. Nadia tells him that he can not call himself an artist since the images are created by the machine/AI and not him. That the images are not his own art.
3. Matthew strongly disagrees and says that if he didn't come up with those ideas, the AI would not generate the Art. Therefore, the Art is created as a consequence of his own prompts/descriptions and ideas. In fact, he is so proud of his idea, that tells Nadia his newly finished AI Art project. He says to have created a cartoony, sad cactus playing a violin in the top of a realistic snowen mountain while cartoony snowmen laugh at him at the base of the mountain. He's very proud of it and brags of having done it in less than 1 minute.
4. Nadia becomes upset. And sarcastically asks Matthew: *""If you are an artist because the art has been made thanks to your ideas... Would anyone who pays someone, or EVEN a group of artists, to make their idea come true, an artist? And would they be the creators of the piece? What if someone come up with your* \[Matthew\] *cactus idea and paid 1 artist to make the character design of the catus and snowmen, 1 artist to think about the composition and color palette, and 2 artists to paint the background, the snowen mountain and the characters... His employees show him different prototypes and he can give them feedback to choose his prefered ones. Would he really be artist themselves because they had the idea? Would the art have been made by him?""*.
5. Matthew laughingly replies: *""Of course not! Of course they wouldn't be the artist. Of course they wouldn't be the authors of the Art piece. There's a HUGE difference between what I said and what you said: I made my Art without anyone, but the guy of your example made it paying people to make it. I came up with my ideas and then made my Art piece without human intervention. That guy ONLY came up with the ideas. If it wasn't for those people he employed, he wouldn't have gotten/created absolutely nothing.""*
6. Nadia histerically replies: *""If it wasn't for the people who DESIGNED, PROGRAMMED and SOLD you the AI, you WOULDN'T have created ANYTHING, Matthew. If it wasn't for the people who MAINTAIN THE SERVERS, DELIVER WIFI TO YOUR HOUSE AND BUILT YOUR OWN PC, you wouldn't have Art at all. You depend as much from other employees and workers as the man from my example does. There's not too much difference between him depending on artists and you depending on all those IT employees that have made the AI, maintain the servers and bring a computer and wifi to your home. But, I* \[Nadia\] *don't depend on anyone!""*
7. Matthew resentfully replies: *""Really Nadia? Do you really think that you don't depend on anyone? Who made the pigments that you bought? Who sow those canvases? Who modeled the rules you use to make those straight lines? Who got the perfect ruby-red acrylic colour that you use?"".*
8. Nadia sighs and says: *""Fair enough Matthew. Some people made my stuff, you are right. But... Can you not see how many effort and skill do I put in each of my paintings? So many days and weeks and... And so many, so many months and years of learning that I've gone through. Do you really think that it takes you the same effort and skill to make one of your 'AI-Art' pieces?""*
9. Matthew: *""No Nadia! Noooo! I would never say that it takes me the same amount of effort to do that. Of course you put sooo much more effort than me. But what I do is Art, nontheless, Nadia. And you are no one to judge!""*

Matthew and Nadia look at eachother for a few seconds. They smile at each other. They change of conversation topic and later leave to have dinner together.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**SOLUTION**

&#x200B;

At the end of the day, I don't think that we can tell who can be considered the owner of a piece of Art and who can't; who can be considered an artist and who doesn't. Since all kind of artists depend in many people and tools (also created by people) to be able to create their art. I think we are looking it at the wrong way. We are looking it as a binary thing, as 2 options: You have either created this piece of art yourself OR you haven't.

But why look it in a binary way? Why there are only 2 possible options? Why does it have to be Black or White? Cold or Hot? Good or Bad?

I propose to see art creation and ownership as a Spectrum. Because I don't think we can see it as just one extreme or the other. That's why I propose these 2 ways of seeing art creation and ownership:

&#x200B;

* **Perecentage of Ownership**

If someone *(Person A)* painted a person with a scarf sat in a chair on top of a hill. And trees, rocks, squirels around... It was painted in different coulours and the time depicted was night, BUT there wasn't any moon nor stars. And then they gave a different person *(Person B)* the painting to paint the moon and the stars, and they did.

I don't think that we can say that one of them did the painting and the other didn't.

I think we could say that Person A made a very high percentage of the painting. Maybe betwen 80% - 95%. And we could say that Person B made a very low percentage of the painting. Maybe between 5% - 20%. But they both did the painting. And they are both artists (not necessarily equally experiencied artists, notheless, Maybe one is a really begginer artist and the other is a very expert artist).

If someone *(Person C)* bought a drawing white and black form a Business *(Person D)* to colour it themselves. And they choose a palette and shadding to colour it. I think we could say that Person C made a moderate percentage of the Art Piece. Maybe between 40% - 50%. And Person D maybe a little more, 50 - 60%.

Even a traditional artist *(Person E)* that have made a piece of Art themselves using canvases, pigments, rules, compasses, tape. It could be said that Person E made a really high percentage of the art themselves. But not all. Maybe they did 98% of the work themselves since people helped them making the materials and tools.

Finally, someone *(Person F)* who comes up with an idea and uses the help of the AI *(Person G)* to create an Art piece, we could say that they have made an Art Piece. But that they made a really low percentage of it. Like 0.1% to 4%.  While the Person G (the AI) has made a really high percentage of the Art Piece. Like 96% - 99.9%.

&#x200B;

* **Points or Level of Effort**

We could also value the Art Piece that someone made by using levels or points of effort.

Effort is how much time and perserverance and difficulty you needed to achieve something.

We could take into account different types of effort:

\- **Creative Effort.** This type of effort would be related to the effort to coming up with the ideas and the messages, composition and meaning and emotions of your art piece. Whether it's made from imagination or using help of reference or even imitating real life, would affect the creativity effort.

\- **Technique Effort.** This type of effort would take into account technical and skill aspects such as line, shapes, forms, perspective, anatomy, value, light and shadow... And it also would take into account how much time has someone spent making the Art Piece.

\- **Education Effort.** Finally this would take into account all the formation and time that the artist has received and employed to develop the skills and technique and knowledge used to create the pieces.

By this metrics, we could make the following examples:

\- A child makes a quick, really low-quality drawing. -> Extremely low effort -> 7 points of effort.

\- A begginer artist makes a painting in 3 hours of low-quality -> Low effort -> 67 points of effort.

\- A begginer artist makes a painting in 11 days of low-quality -> Medium effort -> 235 point of effort.

\- An experienced artist makes a very simple coloured drawing in 4 hours, but with a great idea and execution -> High effort -> 1,479 points of effort.

\- A master digital artist makes a really high-quality art piece in 4 days -> Very High Effort -> 4,054 points of effort.

\- An AI-artist makes an Art piece with a good idea in 34 minutes -> Quite Low Effort -> 15 points of effort. (And the developpers of the AI -> 546,359 points of effort)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSION**

&#x200B;

To sum it up, my opinion is that we shouldn't decide if someone actually made an Art piece or not; if someone is actually an artist or not. I think that we should accept that they have made that Art Piece. However, we should value the merits of it by the amount/percentage of participation and/or by the effort and skills when getting the ideas, executing the technique and all the education that the artist needed to accomplish it.

Here are my own views on AI art:


Negative:
- Could potentially replace less skilled artists (or replace most artists) especially for commission and concept art.

- A very different skillset is introduced to the artmedium, something many artists are not interested in (at least not me). This means artists will not just have competition from themselves but also people who are well versed in AI-technology/programming as well as just people who prefer AI.

- The skill required to create ""good art"" is lowered as you basically only need to learn composition to create beautiful pictures. Meaning there will be less demand for people selling art as it's easier to learn yourself.

- Games would look janky af if everything was made using ai art

- AI can copy artstyles which means individuality in the art community will be harder cause technically you don't own your own artstyle and now everyone can steal it.



Positive:
-  Easier to take on big projects by yourself, meaning more competition towards big companies. 

- Maybe better working conditions for Mangakas???? (Less workload)



Neutral:
- Most of the negatives don't apply to hobby artists

- More people interested in making stuff

640;ArtistLounge;x5g7tc;"""AI Art"" is not just typing a prompt and getting a picture";"I apologize for making yet another post about the Topic of the Moment, but I've read some of the other discussions and they seem to show a misunderstanding of what AI art is and what it can do.

The discussion tends to center around the well-known AIs that have the following functionality: The user types in a prompt, and then the algorithm generates an image based on the tagged images in its input data. Then there's a lot of discussion about what the user's role here is, whether the user is an artist, whether the algorithm is in some sense stealing from the artists who created the input images, and so on.

But that's not the only thing these AIs can do: Many of them can also generate based on starter images. So someone can draw a couple of vague shapes and combine them with a text prompt to gain a fully rendered image. In some versions, you can also select a section of an image and have the AI draw something there in a way that matches the rest of the image. Here's the first [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N913hReVxMM) I found on the topic, in case you can't picture what I mean.

And at that point it becomes a bit difficult to draw the boundary between art made by a human and art made by an AI. After all, many digital artists already use things like ""tree"", ""wave"" or ""grass"" brushes to render parts of images that they don't find interesting to do by hand. If the same artist now wants to draw a picture of someone with a dog, but doesn't want to draw a dog, is she suddently not an artist if she puts the picture through an AI to add the dog? What if the thing she adds is something like a building or cityscape, that many artists in the past would have used a filtered photo for?

Now, that doesn't mean you suddenly have to agree that putting a text prompt into Midjourney is serious artistic work. But I do think it's necessary to understand that it's a continuum, with texture brushes on one end, and full text-to-image generators on the other end. And any line you can draw on that continuum is somewhat arbitrary - maybe having the PC generate some background trees for your image is fine, but generating a foreground figure isn't? Maybe either is fine, but not both? Or both are fine, as long as you define the areas you want trees or figures in by hand?

I'm not saying there's a correct answer to this. If anything, I'm probably relatively far on the ""AI bad"" side and am in principle willing to condemn things like effect brushes as well. But I also understand that a lot of artists have a very high workload and are willing to take any shortcut available to them. In any case I think this functionality of AI should be kept in mind when discussing it, flattening it down to ""type prompt, get image"" is too simple.";24;0;0,41;2022-09-04 09:46:56;Digital Art;https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/x5g7tc/ai_art_is_not_just_typing_a_prompt_and_getting_a/;tutto_cenere;504;neutral;artist;discussion about functionality of AI as context;;;

Or do you only use AI art as your work? And how?

What applications do you use?

I'm looking forward to see your experience! 

Honestly at the moment I'm using AI for inspiration but thinking about a paintover process based on title and original artwork to generated a new piece which I'll be painting over it and changing it to suit my expectations(I'm not sure what app to use for this particular process, and I would be delighted to receive your tips and tricks)";6;0;0,25;2022-10-01 08:22:31;Discussion;https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/xsmzb5/ai_generated_art/;evoooooooo666;106;neutral;artist;question about ai workflow;;;

669;ArtistLounge;11scp2u;Glaze has been released;"I just got the email from the Glaze team that it's now available to download and use. It's supposed to help prevent effective use of your images in AI image generator fine-tuning training. It looks like an interesting AI tool for artists, even if it isn't perfect.

I quoted the email below, only change I made was fixing the links that didn't format correctly when copying it from email.

 "" Hello everyone!  
 

It’s a big day! Today is the day we are (finally) ready to release the  first version of Glaze, the tool for protecting digital images of your  art so that it cannot be used as training fodder for AI art models that  mimic your artistic style. It’s been a busy few weeks since the initial  news of Glaze went out on NYT and other outlets, but we’ve been busy  putting a real usable software wrapper around the core machine learning  algorithms we developed months ago.  
 

To be clear, this is not going to be perfect, and it may not meet all  the different needs of the diverse artist community. But we wanted to  get this version released so that interested artists can have something  they can use today to protect themselves. We’re looking forward to  seeing it in use by artists, and hearing feedback from you on your  experience (there are webforms both for general feedback and bug reports  on the project page).  
 

Please note that we have a user guide/FAQ page [https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/guide.html](https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/guide.html) online with step by step instructions on how to run Glaze on your own  art. The app is now available for Windows, and Mac (for both Intel chips  and Mac M1/M2 machines). The initial download can take a bit of time  (because Glaze depends on some ML libraries and preset models),  depending on the speed of your network connection. And the glazing  process is somewhat compute-intensive, particularly for higher-res  images. Please read our webpages for detailed instructions and answers  to potential questions you may have.  
 

The download page is here. [https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/download.html](https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/download.html)  
 

Finally, thank you for your patience so far, and again as we learn from feedback to fix issues and improve Glaze.  
 And a big thank you to all our artist collaborators (Karla, Lynds, Nathan) and many others in the community for your support.  
 

Ben, on behalf of the Glaze Team @ UChicago.

I like the concept because especially since the fall of deviantart it’s become painful to find an artist-focused social media to post your stuff to, so I’m curious to see if it goes anywhere. I remember artfol received similar hype but… once it was released it kinda remained extremely niche, so idk.

687;ArtistLounge;12riofc;Movement to watermark AI generated content.;"Just wanted to inform you guys that we're kicking off a movement to try to pressure companies that create generative AI to watermark their content (steganographically\[the encrypted & hard to reverse engineer kind\] or using novel methods).

It's getting harder to detect the noise remnants in AI-generated images and detectors don't work all the time.

 Many companies already have methods to detect their generations but they haven't released the services publically.

We're trying to fight the problem from its roots.

That's for proprietary AI models, in terms of open-source models we're aiming to get the companies that host these open-source models like HuggingFace etc. to make it compulsory to have a watermarking code snippet (preferably an API of some sorts so that the code can't be cracked).

I understand that watermarks are susceptible to augmentation attacks but with research and pressure, a resilient watermarking system will emerge and obviously, any system to differentiate art is better than nothing.

The ethical landscape is very gray when it comes to AI art as a lot of it is founded on data that was acquired without consent but it's going to take time to resolve the legal and ethical matters and until then a viable solution would be to at least quarantine or isolate AI art from human art, that way at least human expression can retain its authenticity in a world where AI art keeps spawning.

So tweet about it and try to pressure companies to do so.

This is the movement, it's called APART.

657;ArtistLounge;x1skf0;AI art is not the end of the world, but it's already upending the field of concept art;"I'm writing this to add a different perspective to what I'm sure will be many debates to come. I'm a professional games writer/designer and also a hobbyist musician, and when AI music started to become a thing a few years ago, the music/composing communities had very similar conversations to what I've seen around here recently. Rest assured there is light at the end of the tunnel, but not everyone will like what I'm about to say. 

I've worked at a few different levels of games studios, from solo indie up to AAA, and during that time have worked with and contracted with many great concept artists who were engaged with the project and brought something surprising and fresh to the table; their work, to say the least, created a lasting impact on the game. 

Unfortunately I have also worked with more than a few concept artists who really struggled to succeed--or never did--despite having obvious talent and command over the more technical aspects of their work. Their character sketches were nice to see, their environmental pieces were appropriate and on spec. 

But we had to specify literally *everything* about the design in order to get an interesting result from them. They never turned in anything surprising or inventive. Often literally every aspect of a character had to be described, right down to the pose and clothing and facial expression. Environments had very little in them that we didn't specifically request. They were rarely if ever interested in hearing information about the world/character, and extrapolating that information into something of their own. 

The recent explosion of AI art presents a clear problem for artists like this: if the only thing you make is what you're prompted to make, then what value can you bring to a project that an AI couldn't do for far less money?

To be clear: AI will never be able to replace an artist who imbues their work with emotion and purposeful use of technique and style to elicit specific reactions from the viewer. I've seen this mentioned as 'the human touch', but I'm concerned that many (typically younger, less experienced) artists don't seem to understand that a true 'human touch' is so much more than ""I literally moved my hand to create those lines with my pencil/stylus.""

Artists that understand this are going to be just fine. It's not about technique or talent or how 'real' you can make something look; it's about whether you know how to convey emotion through body language and facial expressions; it's about whether you know how to use composition and cinematography (to at least at a very basic level) to emphasize/de-emphasize something in the shot; it's about being able to convey motion and weight and story without a single word. 

You don't have to take my word for it. Here's a short talk given by one of the industry's best: https://youtu.be/lA5HG8Q4sKg?t=125

Even if you don't do concept art in games, his talk is still worth a listen as he gives away some incredibly powerful secrets to creating powerful work that no AI could ever match.";4;12;0,64;2022-08-30 22:49:09;Discussion;https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/x1skf0/ai_art_is_not_the_end_of_the_world_but_its/;RainRainThrowaway__;512;neutral;designer;discussion about ai upending concept art;;;
16;DefendingAIArt;11nz2n6;The 3D artist community seemed to have less negative reactions to AI, how come?;"So Imma get straight to the point. When this tech basically just got released and when all the controversy started, I've seen different groups react to it in different ways.

I've seen most negative reactions come from (Twitter) artists who draw by hand/pen/drawing tablet/etc.

The 3D artists (which, I'm also a 3D artist) seemed more positive about the technology, discussing how it can be used to make textures and decals for models and game assets quicker. I myself was also very excited about it. :)

Now the hiphop beat-making community (at least, the ones I'm in) I've also seen some positive reactions where people discussed using AI to help with things such as chord progression and melodies or using AI generated samples to remix into beats.

Now, I could be wrong about this because this is really just what I've seen but it did get me curious what causes all these different and varying reactions?

25;DefendingAIArt;113jg9y;I'm getting more commissions as an AI artist than I ever got before as a purely traditional and digital artist. Here are some takeaways.;"So this is my alt account. I created Braad Tittt as the alternative account on every social media and art platform that is just purely dedicated to making digital art that features beautiful women with big tiddies. (I will incorporate beautiful men if there is a demand for it.) 

I started this project two years ago as an AI assisted digital art project for Instagram. Back then I just did traditional morphing with Photoshop/Ibis Paint and I used FaceApp to alter the appearance of my models. This past year gave us all sorts of advancements in AI generative art. When Stable Diffusion dropped in August, I immediately tied it into my workflow as it is open source and is trained on NSFW imagery.

While I had been building a following on Instagram 2 years ago, I decided that maybe I'd have more luck on a more art dedicated community such as Deviant Art who within the past few months came out as being incredibly pro AI despite half of their current anti AI user base. So I started posting my stuff there and found that they are also a platform to host commission work.

As a freelance artist for most of my existence, I made the mistake of applying my thoughts of commissions when it comes to actual drawing/painting to the work involved with AI generated content. So here I am telling you all that, that was a huge mistake!

I expected to have my AI commissions to take way less time than my hand drawn commissions. I was so wrong.

As an artist, when you approach your canvas you expect to just draw or paint for several hours putting the ink or paint where it needs to be to create the vision. You create the outlines, the sketches, the anatomy of your piece, as a base to add everything else on. As an AI artist, I just realized that you spend the SAME AMOUNT OF TIME generating the images as you do to provide your initial sketch as a traditional artist. In the past it would take me a solid 45 minutes to purely just create the structure via first draft sketch. But when I apply my time to AI assisted art, I find that it takes the SAME AMOUNT OF TIME to generate  a panel of images in which I need to curate from. Generating and curating THE ONE IMAGE can take the same amount of time that it takes to sketch a piece by hand.

Then after you decide on the image you are going to work on to finalize and then you actually bring the image into the apps that you are using to enhance the image. But say that you're just taking the image and adding FaceApp filters, fixing anatomy issues and size morphing, and then adjusting lighting... when all is said in done, you just spent 2 or so hours on ONE AI generated image, from writing the prompt all the way to adjusting lighting.

I made the mistake of offering 20 detailed images for $30. The first commission I received at this rate is taking me the whole week to finish because I'm spending about an hour on average on each individual image. But that was something I had to learn by actually getting my feet wet with it. I've already adjusted my pricing tiers and number of outputs based on learning that my labor x time hasn't really changed even though I'm using more AI in my work.

The point of sharing my experience is to say that, if you are a serious artist, the AI part still doesn't matter. You are going to spend the SAME AMOUNT OF TIME on a piece you put work and care into regardless of your medium. The stereotype/trope of putting some words in a box and pushing a button then you're done as an AI artist is such a lame under assessment of what an actual artist actually does when making an image generation truly sellable.

tl:dr: Don't sell your AI commissions short in contrast to your hand made commissions. You will end up spending the same amount of time on your AI commissions as you do your hand made commissions.";28;97;0,89;2023-02-16 07:57:46;;https://www.reddit.com/r/DefendingAIArt/comments/113jg9y/im_getting_more_commissions_as_an_ai_artist_than/;braadtittt;699;positive;artist;AI is a long process AI, Got more comission as AI artist than traditional, AI takes as much time as a serious artist;;;

So that being the case I can't really just dive in and read this wonderful work that you are doing. But I just need to say thank you for it. The ways people hate on creators for using technology they don't understand is shameful and it's made me seriously rethink whether I would even want any association with the label artist at all which is something that I have been associated with for 20 plus years of my life.

As a photographer and artist, AI has simplified my life tremendously. What used to take me weeks and days can now be accomplished in mere hours. I feel no guilt because I know I am not doing anything wrong. The development of ideas has never been easier, and AI is already making strides in every sector. It is a game-changer. The issue at hand is the replacement of jobs by AI. Humans are highly competent creatures, and they should not be burdened with mundane, repetitive tasks. Why are these still in place? Because it is profitable. The problem lies with the system, not the technology. Repetitive jobs could have already been replaced by machinery long before the AI frenzy. However, the media, which is purchased and sold, aims to generate fear among the public by claiming that AI will take over creative jobs like art and writing when, in fact, they are the very people who belittle these gifted individuals and support the system. This is the epitome of hypocrisy. In my view, AI should make things better. It must be wielded by the right people. It should destroy obsolete work systems and create a better world. Humans are capable of extraordinary things, and we should not be trapped in repetitive tasks that rob us of our potential.

I was open about this fact, added it to description of the game and title of the post, and also my game is free to play. 

But when i posted it on various subs, i was attacked by anti-ai activists, who wrote comments (that honestly looked like ai-generated, because of how simillar they were) about AI art being a theft, how i should not make games i don't have money for tha artist, and proceeded to donwvote all the posts i made about it (or maybe each sub had those kind of people?). The only sub where it was not downvoted were dedicated to ai art, but there were only 5 upvotes - seems like people there interested in pictures more than in games.

I am not too bothered with that, since that just proves the point i made with the game - that i do not have place in this world, and will always face rejection from society no matter what i try. In any case this game were not a serious project, just a way to say goodbye. But would still like to have at least one real feedback about game itself, and not about use of AI art.

167;DefendingAIArt;11eallf;This seems like the best place to ask for some advice.;"So I'm using Synthesized Art in the game I am making, and I'm a little leery about how to go about advertising that fact.

* I do want to be honest and open about it, I think it's really cool what I've been able to accomplish with it, other indie devs could use this to more directly compete against the unfinished AAA corporate trash that keeps being dumped on the market.
* I have no intention of trying to hide it and pass the art off as something I did with a pen.
* The current backlash against it could sink my game before it even launches.
* The current backlash against it could also be a huge boost to my game if it gains negative attention where there was previously none.

In the end I'm very trepidatious about even mentioning it. I'd like to at some point even do tutorials or videos targeted to other game developers on how I incorporated it into my workflow. (The technical side of it is moving so damn fast I can barely keep up, but the workflow hasn't changed much since day one, 6m ago).

I think it's a very cool, and even a marketable aspect of my game. It's sped up development time considerably, and is a potential boon to my (indie game) industry. But it's clearly a huge minefield right now, and I'm just not sure where to step.

I'm a decent artist myself, but my skills are more technical than creative, so I can take a generated image and turn it into a game-usable asset very quickly, but creating something from scratch usually takes me a long time. So synthesized art has allowed me to bring a game idea to fruition in far FAR less time than if I had made the art myself (and at a higher detail level). Nearly everything, down to the *individual letters of the fonts* have been done with SD. Someone without the technical skills would not be able to turn a thousand generated images into a game, but I'm at a loss how to enter this ""war"" without getting shot.

Now, many other indie devs have similar art skills as my self, and what they do is what I used to do: grab an image off google and manipulate it into something else that can't be sued for copywrite. Nobody ever bitched about that. Infact photobashing is not only an industry standard, it's how the vast majority of concept art in AAA studios is made. Now THAT is cheating and ""stealing"" in all the ways people are bashing on AI art, yet, nobody cares.

187;DefendingAIArt;11ra5ax;The misrepresentation of the lowest definition;"I think that what infuriates me more about luddites is the way they generalize all AI art based on a misrepresentation of its lowest definition possible. What I mean is how they say ""All AI generation is writing words, there's no skill knowledge nor technique involved in that"" and that is just pure bullshit.

First of all ""just writing words"" or prompt engineering as I prefer to call it, does require knowledge to get decent results. Knowledge that is even shared with more traditional art mediums like painting, photography and digital art. You need to understand concepts like resolution, framing, art styles, famous painters and much more. It's not as easy as writing ""give pretty waifu, Greg Rutkowsi style!!!1!"" Do they think the computer reads our mind and magically generates the image we want?

And while I can concede that there are people that don't put much effort in their prompting, I strongly believe that: 
 a. They are a diminute minority of the community and  
b. They sooner than later start to develop more intricate methods because... 
Mind blowing fact about life: nobody is born knowing! Learning requires experimentation! Show us the best painters first drawings when they were a child and I'm sure they were imperfect and lacked details and style. Nobody creates masterpieces when first trying a new art medium.

And I repeat, only a small subset of AI artists stop at prompt engineering. The technology is constantly evolving and we are trying as best as we can to follow its progress and learn the new tools and techniques. Some of the first that come to my mind and that 99,9 of us use are: imgtoimg, in-painting, out-painting. 

But there's more, because some people methodology consists on something like: drawing a rough sketch in a graphic tablet, send it to the AI and generate hundreds of variations, mixing some of their favorites using photo-bashing, send the result to the AI again and finally edit the details in Photoshop. There's even people that use 3D software as a way to guide the AI generation for God's sake! And I believe these people are incredibly talented, they take it very seriously, are knowedgable and skilled: They are undoubtedly ARTISTS";10;6;0,81;2023-03-14 18:02:58;;https://www.reddit.com/r/DefendingAIArt/comments/11ra5ax/the_misrepresentation_of_the_lowest_definition/;JedahVoulThur;368;Positive;artist;misinterpresentation of AI;;;

So, artists or non-artists currently using AI no longer have an online space to discuss about Art as they once had.

Sure, subs like Midjourney and other AI art systems are welcoming, but still, they are specialized in a narrow domain.

**Question**:   Is there any sub similar to ArtistLounge or the big Art sub where you   can freely discuss about AI art (and non-AI art too) without being   afraid of touching a ""taboo"" subject?

I   couldn't find: now, it seems like any space to discuss art in reddit  is  making a clear distinction between traditional artists and artists  who  use the slightest AI help.

For better or worse, I just created such space: **TheDeepArt** sub.

The idea is to have a sub equivalent to the big Art sub but without the restrictions around AI.

**So, to describe this group:**

There   you are expected to talk or post whatever you are allowed to post in   subs like ArtistLounge, Art, and other big subs related to   drawing/illustration, with the difference that there is no restriction   whatsoever around the AI art subject.

Btw, I am a traditional artist (pencil and paper). I do drawings for a living.

The   only thing I am ""mad"" about AI systems is that they didn't include my   drawings in the training data. Maybe because I am not a well known top   artist. I would love to have my efforts included in a system that will   allow any person to create illustrations without having to go through   the immense trouble of years of studying like I did.";43;59;0,95;2023-01-04 23:11:35;;https://www.reddit.com/r/DefendingAIArt/comments/103f6lj/just_take_a_look_at_the_rule_11_of_the_art/;cesarscapella;279;Positive;artist;no safe space to talk about ai art;;;
231;aiwars;139g0na;For those who hold a negative stance toward AI, I would like to pose a question to you. Would you still consider someone an artist if they have been creating art for years, but have recently incorporated AI into their creative process?;"Edit: I know the percentage of anti-AI people is low and that the average person is neutral or positive toward AI art. I'm just curious to see what anti-AI people think.

I know this is a bit long, but hopefully, this helps people understand how AI could be used as a tool and assist you in making your art. You could also make beautiful concepts with AI and actually make them have ""emotion"" and ""soul"", as most anti-ai people don't like to believe.

So, I've been creating art for years since when I was in my teens as a means to heal from my childhood trauma, and now as a hobby. I usually like to make photobashed art using Photoshop/Illustrator. I've only recently gotten into creating AI art after being against it for a good year. I wasn’t able to create art for a good while, at least 2 years, because I work as a vaccine developer as my day job so my time has become very limited. Trust me when I say it was starting to make me depressed because I create art as a way to relax and calm myself from my anxieties/depression. Not being able to create anything for at least 2 years was really making me question whether or not I loved my job and if I should even work there because not being able to make art was affecting my mental health.

My journey with Photoshop/Illustrator started when I was creating 3D clothing for my simulation games and learned how to use it to create textures for my models. As I became more skilled, I realized that I could use these skills to create art. I began with a piece called ""Chained Memories,"" which was a combination of 3D modeling and editing in Photoshop/Illustrator. From there, I learned how to photobash using Photoshop/Illustrator to create unique pieces.

I started reading more about AI and decided to give it a try, and honestly, I was in awe. I would use my old art and sketches as references to train my AI, and it was able to get down my vision exactly like I imagined it in my head, and not only that, but it would sometimes give me variations and lead me to a whole new path from what I originally wanted to create. Now, I use AI as a tool to assist me in my creative process. I'm not the type to generate pictures and just slap my name on it. I still spend 10+ hours on my pieces.

My boyfriend is a traditional artist who paints with his hands and was also against the usage of AI for a good while as well, until I convinced him to experiment with using AI with me. He too saw the possibilities and how it could help him. For him, he uses it whenever he feels like he has artist's block and has a hard time putting his ideas together to create a cohesive piece. He doesn't paint exactly what the AI gives him, but it will give him new ideas and help him figure out how to better organize all the shapes, characters, etc. to create a cohesive painting.

After putting a lot of time and effort into editing, my final product may look vastly different from the AI-generated images that served as my inspiration. However, like any other form of art, people can find inspiration in the work of others and create their own pieces based on that style. Although the resulting artwork may have differences, you can still see the influence of the original artist. For instance, I have a deep admiration for Monet and Klimt, and I find that AI is particularly effective at creating impressionist art due to the random patterns it generates.

I believe you still need skills in order to use AI efficiently because text2image is not very good at putting ideas together, in my opinion, or at least my ideas. I have to input my own sketches as references in order for it to finally give me something that I want and am able to work with. Previously, it was commonplace for individuals to acknowledge the influence of certain artists in others' work. However, with the rise of AI, if an image resembles the style of another artist, people are quick to accuse it of theft, disregarding the fact that it is only the style that appears similar.

Imagine, if you will, a handmade painting of an elephant in the style of the great Van Gogh, resembling his iconic Starry Night, and it looks like Van Gogh could've probably painted it himself. However, it must be noted that Van Gogh has never portrayed an elephant in his unique style. In such a scenario, would the creation of the elephant piece be deemed theft? It is important to recognize that this unique creation of the elephant would not have come to existence without the artist's contribution and innovation.

A quick summary of an example of how I've recently started making my art with the assistance of AI:

1. First, I input my old art or my rough sketches into the program and use simpler prompts and fewer steps to generate the image to save time on computation. I prioritize quantity over quality and choose the desired color and style later.
2. Since the generated image is close to what I want, but of course since it's AI, the facial features are rough, and there tends to be an extra hand or oddly shaped hands, that I can't remove with prompt tweaking alone. So, I then take the image to Photoshop for the first round of touch-ups and add/remove details.
3. With the overall composition confirmed, I continue adjusting the prompts while testing different models. Since different models excel in different areas, I need to try multiple options before finding the one that can provide more intricate details for the current image. I increase the number of steps and resolution for more detailed results, which takes more time, so I usually run several images at once while doing something else.
4. Then, I switch between 2-4 different variations, adjusting their weights until I find the desired facial features and shape. I can make adjustments to the model at the same time in Photoshop or Illustrator, or I can finalize the model first and then fine-tune it.
5. Once everything is completely finished, I like to go over it using neural filters and correct my picture using ""camera raw filter"" in Photoshop without any further AI generation. From this point on, it's just my own skills in Photoshop/Illustrator. I will add/change details such as changing colors, adding/removing patterns, adding aspects to the background, adding emotion to the piece by adding emotion to my characters' faces, fixing the hands, feet, face, etc. by drawing in my own hands, face, feet, fingers, toes, etc.
6. Finally, once all the changes are complete and the image looks cohesive. I will go in for a last round of final touches, such as lighting, shading, highlights, etc.

Also, those who believe that AI can't be used to make concept art because of the generated randomness is wrong. That's all I ever create: concept art. All of my art has meaning. For example [https://ibb.co/9Y1wzCY](https://ibb.co/9Y1wzCY)

The picture on the left is the AI-generated image I created using my sketch as a reference and used the generated image as my inspiration. The one on the right is my final product. For the concept of this piece, I wanted to create science art representing DNA and the connection of life on earth, and how DNA is the base of life. The inspiration for the clear globe and the mountains on the bottom was a snow globe. I wanted a way to include the earth or represent the earth but I didn’t want to be too literal and add planet earth. So I decided to metaphorically represent the earth with the clear globe with many plants and butterflies. The DNA is made of flowers and my inspiration for this was “the tree of life”. I included the moon to let my audience know that the sphere surrounded by flowers and butterflies is supposed to represent the Earth. I used mountains as a holder for my “snow globe” to further insinuate that the picture represents the earth and life on earth.";28;13;0,79;2023-05-06 10:41:36;;https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/139g0na/for_those_who_hold_a_negative_stance_toward_ai_i/;Boshokie;1381;positive;artist;use AI in their workflow, help making art when busy, help generating ideas to use as inspiration, use result of AI;;;
254;aiwars;12uqk5m;Examples of incorporating AI in an artist's workflow;"I saw another post about this, but felt it was far from the mark. I'm not going to pretend I have tips that will work for everyone, and I bet there's tips in other subs than this one. But given that I've been talking to people who understand very little of *my* workflow on this sub, I figured it might enlighten some of the AI people who suggest AI as a tool for artists. And also be some suggestions for fellow artists.

*Edit: A little clarification before I waste your time reading something that doesn't apply to you. This is all* ***Stable Diffusion***, *I have not used Midjourney or other popular AI services and don't know if any of this is possible with those. I know someone who uses Midjourney, but it is certainly a case of the AI doing literally everything and doesn't seem like a good tool for steps in the workflow of an artist.*

*I also went over the post to clarify that some of these methods are a grey area in terms of law and would not combine well with professional work. I'd also like to add while I have your attention that crutches stifle growth and relying heavily on AI will make you a worse artist, you have to take responsibility for your own actions.*

I'll try to take this step by step by explaining what I would normally do, and how I can do it with AI after.

>Artist: A client has a request for a particular subject, every single job starts with this, the client can be a boss or a commissioner or myself. My first job as someone who translates ideas to paper is to understand the idea, so I will find out more about this particular subject by asking questions and doing research. I'll be looking for things that I can use visually to create this character and not a generic character. Many of the things I discover I will then find references for so I can accurately depict them.

AI: With AI I can sometimes generate these references instead of searching for them, while Google search is quick and usually on point, it doesn't always give me what I'm looking for. AI can take multiple different prompts better than a Google search, and can spit out 4 images per second, making it likely that in a minute I will have something of use. I generate armor and clothing, streets, haircuts, tattoos, interiors, character interactions, and so on. I don't use it directly, it just helps me in my work to see where I'm heading and I can use the elements I like. It can also randomly understand a prompt differently than I thought it would and provide a new perspective I hadn't thought about. I'd call this incorporating AI in the research and inspiration phase, it's a quick but sometimes less in-depth and accurate way to do it.

>Artist: With my references and notes for the subject done, I move on to the canvas and sketch out ideas, I focus on shapes here trying to capture a personality and vibe, while creating something visually interesting and appealing. This is called thumbnailing and consists of dozens or hundreds of very low detail sketches that take a short time to create.

AI: I can prompt AI with my ideas and see what it spits out as well, but usually this doesn't yield good results. Something I do benefit from in my workflow is throwing my thumbnails into ControlNet and having the AI generate things based on my prompt within the shape of my thumbnail. I have aphantasia so for me it helps to see if my silhouette can work. As any artist will tell you a thumbnail can go in a million different directions. Letting the AI send it in a million different directions while I grab a cup of tea and clear my mind can help speed up my work. It will not explore all the directions I would've thought of given some time, but thinking them up and sketching them out would cost a lot of time, and it might go in directions I didn't expect.

>Artist: Now that thumbnails and sketches have been created I will select which ones to commit to developing more, and I'll likely start incorporating some of the references I found earlier directly. For this step the goal is to make something that I could show my client and they will understand what's happening on the canvas. That means this iteration has to communicate everything the final piece communicates, but with as little effort as possible. In my case, this is the part that takes the longest time and is also what I enjoy the least in my art. For me, I have seen what I want from the thumbnail with a rough sketch over it, and I want to move on to a new project.

AI: Sadly, so far I haven't seen much use of AI for the difficult part of this step, namely drawing the owl from two circles. What AI does help with, on the other hand, is render a final sketch that's done cleanly into a practically finished rendering. This is something I would never waste time on doing manually before something is approved, but with AI I can have it generate variations in high resolution that tell the client more than just my lines and this seems to help for the client. This is useful to me because I will have less things to correct later if the client understands better what the end result will be without telling me to change course.

>Artist: With an approved detailed sketch my job is to render it so that it can go to another step in production or home to a client or be uploaded to my portfolio. This is another time-consuming process that I find meditative, but not important to me personally, and automation would be welcome to increase throughput. This involves flat colors, probably a lot of selection tool or precise brush work, values, details and so on. The benefit for me is that this is mostly autopilot, the problem is I can spend a day instead of starting on a new project which is where I excel.

AI: If accuracy and quality isn't of utmost importance here, letting the AI loop over and over in img2img from the pseudo rendered piece in the previous step that was approved can lead to a decently rendered final piece, depending on how unique the style is that you're going for. I have to go over it to fix errors in perspective and proportions, but it gets an okay result. I don't like doing this because I like having control of the final step, and actually going in and reclaiming the art as my own would take longer than just making it my own from the previous step. This feels like the most controversial step to use AI for, but I think there's a lot of phenomenal sketch artists out there who could branch out to rendered paintings with a tool like this. A warning that this process, even if you paint over details and fix errors by hand after, will most likely *void any copyright* to the final image.

\-

Bonus use-cases:

Generating backgrounds for artists who don't have the time or the skill to make backgrounds at the same level as their foreground subject. Be aware that legally this may void copyright.

Generating realistic human faces that aren't real people. I make semirealistic to photorealistic characters often, and to do that with aphantasia I have to use detailed photo references religiously. Sometimes it's not a good idea for the fantasy character to look like a real person people recognize. AI has potential here to make anonymous realistic faces without you having to be a creep yourself and download images from small social media accounts. I don't condone the collection of basically private photos of random people on the internet just because those people were gullible and posted them online, but they do add much needed variety to face generation. To be perfectly clear here, I generate the photorealistic face and use it as a reference the same way I would use a photograph, I paint the face for my artwork manually. The benefit is that the result doesn't look like a famous person, but still looks realistic.

Cleaning up sketches. Sometimes you made a sketch that has strange proportions, missing details and the lines were particularly unsteady. Feeding this sketch to the AI via img2img can clean up the lines while staying true to the original sketch. It will create artefacts, but it can help a long way with cleaning up a messy sketch. But AI people need to invent transparent backgrounds in generations for this to truly be useful because nobody wants the white background merged with their sketch.

Faces on characters. A little hit or miss for me, but if you struggle with faces for characters at a bit of a distance, instead make the head shape and throw it into the Inpainting tool and mask out the face. Then generate a face. Give it a few generations to make one that fits the composition and angle, and then paint it into the rest if it's standing out. Not sure how this would affect copyright. As a concept artist the normal practice for this if the work isn't going to be published is to copypaste purchased stock photo and blend it in. Inpainting is faster, but may not be good from the legal perspective.";12;16;0,81;2023-04-22 04:47:19;;https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/12uqk5m/examples_of_incorporating_ai_in_an_artists/;linuxlut;1588;positive;artist;use AI in their workflow, help generating ideas to use as inspiration, help visualize to client, help making background, generating human faces, cleaning up sketches, help rendering;;;

Quote from the Variety article:

>One of the arguments I see used against AI-Collaborative work is that  it’s ‘soulless,'” Silver writes in her artist statement.  “I see AI as  liberation, as an extension of the imagination, deeply personal,  inexorable from the artist using it.

About the artist: ([https://www.clairesilver.com/about](https://www.clairesilver.com/about)) 

>***STATEMENT***  
I  collaborate with AI to produce art that is transcendental-- art that  evokes in the viewer a wordless truth. Together, we create works that  are greater than either of us could make alone, neither more important  than the other to the process. I also produce physically painted twins  of select digital pieces. In this way, both the AI and the artist can  exist in the same world as our art.  
>  
>***PROCESS***  
As  a millennial, my childhood was mostly analog, shifting into an  increasingly digital existence as I grew.  My process mirrors this,  moving from analog to digital and back again. I work with oil, acrylic,  GAN (Artbreeder), Procreate, collage, photography, and more to create my  work. I often blend the classical style and mythos into my art,  collaboratively producing work that feels at once familiar and strange. I  hope that training the GAN on a traditional painting style will shape  it to bring some of our collective culture forward, while still  expanding and redefining it.  
>  
>***PURPOSE***  
I  explore themes of vulnerability, trauma, disability, social hierarchy,  innocence, and divinity, and question the role they will play in our  transhumanist future.  
>  
>I do not make statements on whether AI is good or bad. I'm a caveman painting fire.  
>  
>With the rise of AI, for the first time, the barrier of skill is swept away: *Taste is the new skill*.  What comes next will be the cream of humanity's entire creative  lineage. It is imperative that we, as a species, take this moment to  recognize the transcendent longing inherent in being human, and that we  commit to bringing it with us into our future.";21;20;0,86;2023-03-08 12:21:16;;https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/11lsqgm/ai_artist_claire_silver_will_exhibit_at_the/;Me8aMau5;437;positive;artist;fine artist, ai is extension of art, use AI in their workflow, GAN;;;
368;aiwars;12rtk8g;The difference between an AI tool and a camera and graphic design tools?;"In these debates, I always see that AI is not a tool, it's the actual artist. Wouldn't that also apply for a digital camera then? Let me explain:

*In both, the operator inputs parameters, presses a button, and gets back a result. The camera, like the AI tool, is doing most of the “work” to generate the image the operator wants based on their initial inputs.*

*Instead of toggling buttons, and setting a scene physically, in AI  text-to-image, ""words"" are the toggles and directions to set the scene.*

This is even more true now as camera technology implements a lot of AI in order to capture the best results in a variety of conditions with minimal human effort.

But framing still matters. Composition still matters. Knowing which settings to use to capture the best results still matters.

Give the same camera to a photographer and some random joe and ask them to go take a photo of the sunset, and you will quickly see the difference in their ""artistry"" given the same exact tool, subject and constraints.

Sure, there is an additional element in AI generations because the output can be more affected by the AI than a camera would influence a photograph, but the machine is doing the actual work to achieve the desired effects.

I really view AI much like a camera. While a camera captures snapshots of visuals you encounter in real life, an AI is like a camera for your mind, capturing and rendering visuals in your imagination.

Ultimately, I think this is indeed the direction technology will eventually go: the ability to ""think"" and render something for others to see. The creative work would literally all take place within your mind.

Perhaps I've been more willing to embrace this technology because I've always viewed art **more about recombination than replication**. AI is an incredibly powerful recombination tool, allowing me to combine disparate elements and styles nearly instantly to bring a vision to life.

When I use these tools, I don't view myself as an artist, more like an explorer/director/curator/designer.

I've embraced AI I think in part because my background is more in graphic design and photography. I view it as more of an extension of tools I've used before like Photoshop and Illustrator.

I can see why there is more of a blowback from illustrators though, since their creative process is often much different.

I used to do photoshop battles 20 years ago, and the process then was more laborious. If I wanted to render an image of George W. Bush riding a Dragon over a war-torn Iraq, this would be my process:

1. Scour the internet for photos of the individual elements I'd need for the composition
2. Painstakingly remove the background from each element I want to use in the composition
3. Arrange the elements in the composition to tell the story I want to tell visually
4. Work on matching colors, lighting and shadows between elements so that they look as cohesive as possible

Today, the process even within just Photoshop itself is much easier to accomplish, thanks to AI. You can instantly remove a background. Instantly add filters so that every element looks like a cohesive whole.

And in the process I described, I was still reliant on photos other people took, and much more constrained in what was available to use, often reliant on stock photos and such.

But do people trash people who use Photoshop today because it's so much easier than it was 20 years ago? I don't see it.

So I wish the anti-AI crowd would take a moment to step back and see how this is indeed simply a tool. Like any other tool, it can be used for good or for bad. It can be used lazily or to stretch the boundaries of artistic expression. It's ultimately up to the person utilizing the tool.";20;7;0,74;2023-04-19 16:37:00;;https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/12rtk8g/the_difference_between_an_ai_tool_and_a_camera/;ShaneKaiGlenn;629;positive;artist;ai is similar to photography, make development of ideas easier;;;

but an actual skilled artist could take that same rough image of a space ship and turn it into something that is truly amazing and create something that is way better than someone who just used a few prompts to make the orignal image..

Now don't get me wrong midjourney can create some pretty cool images, but it does not seem to take a lot of risk when it comes to the type of art it creates, and because of that a lot of its art can end up looking be very generic.  Honestly, I think these AI art generators are going to make the work of real artists stand out a lot more simply because they are more willing to take risk and go outside of their confront zones in ways that an AI like midjourney or Dalle clearly does not want to do

1. AI is going to make everyone poor, kill all digital art market in a few years, if not even traditional art. We are all doomed because it's growing exponentially, just wait for it.

2. AI ""art"" is shit, and will always be. That's NOT the common sense perception. That's usually what good artists or people who have deep studies in it, who have trained eyes, can see. Most people see it as pretty pieces, and pay as much attention to it as a pretty drawing for a random artist in the internet. Hell, I even saw hundreds of people thinking that the whole Balenciaga video meme generation is truly _beautiful_. Besides, many people drool over realism for fast consumption, which is the most optimized aspect of AI now.

Please, instead of making people even more anxious, I want to remember everyone WHY we make art. It's to _express ourselves_. To tell stories of our perceptions and experiences of the world.

Although technique is crucial, it's NOT why we started. And technique is the only thing a machine can have. You can even ask ChatGPT about it — mind you, I work with software development, and I often use it for studying my code.

Remember when you were a kid, and you draw that weird stick figure with a crooked face. For your parents, that was pure art. It is way, way more significant than a semi realistic rendered cute waifu similar to thousand others. Only us, humans, have the power to tell meaning stories, doesn't matter what tools we use.

Personally, I started drawing and painting because I wanted to express myself, to distract my mind out of the terrible things I was facing, and, also, because my girlfriend loved to see it.

It can create lots of crazy good art and I believe there will be a new class of artists who are good at editing and photoshopping producing great AI art. However, I still believe that the demand for human art is not going away. AI art can only provide what it wants to generate and cannot input an artist's true vision on paper. It cannot also have a personality and style that only an artist can be known for. As artists, we should embrace this technology to enhance our process, for example, we can use them as reference or inspiration. 

The issue here is how to deal with AI art vs human art. Well, I believe going forward, real human art should be recorded in real time and sped up in social media format. This way, we can vet human art. I truly believe people still appreciate raw talent and skill. Also, as I mentioned, an artist usually has a certain style and personality that fans enjoy. 

This is my take on this new phenomenon and I hope it becomes a tool and another form of art that does not compete with human talent art.

I was curious because as an artist, I look at artwork and wonder if a person really made it, or did a program? Looking at what people have posted - I feel like why should I try, everyone is better than me. Well, using that program gave me an inkling about how some cool pictures could be made, all without being an artist.

You have to have discord account to use it. You type in /imagine and a prompt appears. I've seen a paragraph used to describe an image but in general, I used maybe 8 -12 words for my pictures. Sometimes they turned out amazing. There was some duds - the AI doesn't know what mermaids are or merhorses hahaha And if you have a bunch of words that don't make sense, it simply won't include those. Some can be boring and some surprising. 

In the end, I found that it was actually inspiring to me. I like many different styles of art and this program brought out the surrealist in me. So what if others use it - I just liked the crazy and interesting things it created with my text. And sometimes I would say to myself - I can do that better! 

If you try it out, save the 24 you make because when you hit the 25, they'll ask you to subscribe and I don't think you'll see them again. I did take the basic because I'm curious and it did something for me. I had a lot of fun. If you want to just do a month you can. I'm not affiliated with them, but I thought others might like to have an ""inspiration"" buddy when you have a block going on.";14;0;0,17;2023-03-26 07:48:01;Positivity/Success/Inspiration;https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/122bd1c/i_tried_out_an_ai_program_and_had_some/;justvermillion;302;positive;artist;AI is great for inspiration;;;
402;aiwars;12jxauz;Why I love and hate AI art.;"So today someone was asking me about one of my backgrounds in a piece and they recoiled when I told them that the background isn't my creation entirely. That it's mostly AI. What I do is I sketch up a background, usually wide sweeping fields into mountains with rivers, but I don't get into the serious detail because once I have a good base I send it through an AI with it set to put trees and the detail that's not the main focus of the piece. Now, I DO go through the tedious task of tracing everything over. It doesn't take forever, but it does take longer than I'd like to admit. After the background is done? I use the creation part of my mind. I'll add in an array of things. Castles, Planes, skies, planets, medieval sieges/battles, or do some where's Waldo stuff. 

THAT is why I love AI Art. It can take the tedious part of creating menial and unimportant details while following a baseline I give it. Yet, what makes me hate it? 

This IS going to irk some folk but I can't stand the work that just gets born out of some words. There are a lot (NOT ALL) but a lot of people who type in some keywords/phrases, get a lot, choose a couple, send them through, and repeat until something comes up they like and posting that. Yes, it's art! However, when it doesn't have the live artist making any serious contribution other than some words to the piece? Then it's not ""theirs"". A piece should have the artists own muster in it, their ""blood, sweat, and tears"" so to say.  

Either way you look at it I support it. If you like throwing in a cool phrase and re-filtering that a dozen times? Good for you and keep doing so. Do what makes you happy. 

Oh! And the other massive part of why I hate it? ***C***heese ***P***izza . . . if you understand what I'm getting at there? You probably agree with me. It's just wrong.";5;11;0,72;2023-04-12 23:06:32;;https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/12jxauz/why_i_love_and_hate_ai_art/;Witcher_Errant;346;positive, negative;artist;"use AI in their workflow, make development of ideas easier, condemn AI artist that just ""type and select""";;;
632;ArtistLounge;xx5e5c;I always dreamed AI art existed, but now I think it may be my doom;"I'll spill the beans: I always loved art but I hated the process. When I started to learn digital art, and I realized how many steps were required to do a competent piece, it just destroyed any fun. And in all honestly, Im not a good artist at all, not when I started 12 years ago, nor now.

Deep inside me I always dreamed of a machine where you put a prompt and you get the finished art instantly, but I always thought that was imposible... well, it's here. 

So right now, Im at a crossroad. I can finally produce art without the hassling process, because let's be honest, AI results are way better than anything I can draw, and I feel like AI souless fish eyes would be fixed soon enough... not like my art is any better with the same-face syndrome.

Sooner than latter AI art would reach a level of quality you wouln't be able to make a difference between hand crafted of machine crafted.

But also, drawing is my only ""talent"", I have to talent on anything else (not even on drawing but hard work pays it). So, as a disabled individual, its my only source of income. Renouncing to drawing myself would mean renouncing to comms, and I will starve.

In any case AI ""artist"" can produce miles of pieces per month and I barely can finish 2 things per month, so theres no way I can grind myself to popularity on places like Twitter now. It was almost impossible before already, with my art proficiency.

So yeah, I am confused. I want AI art, but I also want my source of income, so I don't know what to do. Even if I reject AI art, people just want instant gratification for free.

636;ArtistLounge;xep7rv;Should people who cant make good art but have a story to speak deserve to have art made for them ?(by ai);"Sorry for the onemillionth+ ai post but i saw this twitter [post](https://twitter.com/emostaque/status/1570123155477499904?s=21&t=uKnZOr0I-qqlVVpNQkek3Q) and the comments under it and it has me feeling conflicted about ai. One guy in the comments said people just want to create freely and i cant help but see ai being the solution for that. For people who cant draw, either be it through lack of skill or actual disability, they might have a story to tell that ai might be able to help them with. Im imagining a dad who gave up his dreams of creating comics to raise kids being able to use the tool to express their story through ai generated comics or whatever. Should he be able to use this tool to express his voice? If i were to say no, i feel as if i were gatekeeping their access to express their voice which feels contradictory to what art is all about. 

It should be noted I vehemently despise the idea of ai art in general. If this thing were to hypothetically grow into something that could effectively replace jobs, give anybody to create whatever they want at whatever accuracy, it would ruin my future plans , hopes n dreams, etc etc. At the same time though, i cant help but feel this comes from a place of bias; if i wasnt an artist i would love to have something that could create the shit ai could make, but since i am one, i feel threatened by it making me and my skills obsolete. 

Anyways, i wanted to hear others thoughts about this. I come from a place of bias and i feel many others here might too when it comes to ai, but i still want to hear what you guys think about it. 

ALSO(thought of this last second), if the issue lies in the fact it uses others art work without consent to create more artwork, would there be any problem if it DID have consent for the art, or, with the work of some supercomputer built by jesus christ himself, not require anybodys artwork at all?";23;0;0,32;2022-09-15 09:24:39;Discussion;https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/xep7rv/should_people_who_cant_make_good_art_but_have_a/;mothecakes;348;positive, negative;artist;giving access to non artist, feel threatened by making my skill obsolte, question about non artist using ai;;;
672;ArtistLounge;11wf9ug;Feeling pressured to keep up with my own AI trained model;"I can't find people in the same situation on the internet, so I'll talk about it here.

&#x200B;

Just to give more context, I've been using AI art generators like stable diffusion and midjourney these past few months.  Putting the ethics of it aside, I really liked the idea of visualizing these ideas in my head that I never had the skill to do so.

&#x200B;

By the time I got to use it, I was already an established artist on DA. I enjoyed posting my work and didn't really care about the likes and watchers all that. The thing I liked was having this sense of accomplishment that someone acknowledged my work. I had no intentions of selling or even publishing those generated AI images on my page. I kept it to myself to avoid getting into arguments and all that. The idea of uploading it and passing it as something I made just feels icky to me. It soon came to a point where I was generating more images in a day than art I've made in a year. I spent literal hours editing prompts to get the results I like, this and that, yadda yadda.

&#x200B;

I never really considered myself an ""AI artist"" because in truth I was really just some guy playing around with tools. I would never claim an AI image was my own. All I was using it for really, was to generate really specific references. I didn't like drawing from references I found on the internet because I could get myself in shit if the original poster of that image got mad at me for failing to credit them or that I credited the wrong person, or maybe someone would point out I obviously copied that one image of yada-yada and call me a fake artist, a poser, etc.

&#x200B;

When Dreambooth came out, I was excited to try it. I inputted most of the art I've made and published, including those of my OCs, and it wasn't perfect, obviously, but I was happy that I somewhat managed to train it on my style. I generated thousands of images in one night or so since it felt like seeing the drawings that I could've made. But it soon hit me that I enjoyed generating those images than actually drawing something.

&#x200B;

Things would always go like this: Hmm, I always wondered how my OC would look in (artist I like)'s style, so I do that, cue the moment of ""wow, I like how it turned out!"" then save the image. Some of them I even tried copying, but I just couldn't, and when I realized that, I became unhappy with how incompetent I was, how much of a shit artist I actually was. Every time I failed to copy an AI image, I'd dwell on it for days and ask myself if I really even had skill in the first place. As time passed, drawing became less of an enjoyable activity and more of a laborious act, like I was pressuring myself to do it, but even after hours of painting, I'd get pissed. I can't make something that looks good in my eyes anymore. This may just be me setting up unrealistic standards for myself and rushing myself to improve faster. I guess it's important to point out that it was around this moment too that I became concerned with my follower count (as I reached around 50 that time) and my likes on each of the drawings that I post (if a drawing I made got less than 5 likes in a few hours, I would delete it out of shame) though I'm unsure if it really is related to the AI thing. I was using the images the AI made using on the trained model of my style, and basically just copying it on the other side of the canvas while adding a bit of artistic freedom to it. I was never the creative person, so doing this was a lifesaver for me.

&#x200B;

Right now, I've reached 150 followers and I'm really afraid of losing even just one (but I know it is inevitable so I've kinda come to terms with it, I think). The drawings I upload (that used the AI image as reference) are getting closer to 20-40 likes compared to before (which barely reached 10). I feel pressured to generate more AI images, to make more art from, to make more people like it, to get more likes, to get more followers, so on and so on. I've had panic attacks before if I haven't uploaded a good drawing in a week. I was scared of ""losing the attention"". I'm not blaming anyone or anything. This is a problem with me and not the AI. I guess I've become too dependent on the program, and it's impacting my motivation. I don't know what to do. I just feel so lost. I need to be pointed in the right direction. Any nugget of advice would be appreciated. If you have questions, ask. I'll be happy to answer.
