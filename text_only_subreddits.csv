7,DefendingAIArt,12wms6q,The only Artists who should fear AI are...,"Bottom feeder 'artists' who aren't creative or reasonably talented. Which nowadays is most of the art world. Everyone wants to pretend to be an artist because their mom liked their finger paintings and stick figures. People surrounded by yes-men and echo chambers telling them that they are creative and talented. If such people were actually talented and creative, they would have nothing to fear.

AI cannot replace creativity! AI cannot 'think' like an artist. And it will be a long time before AI is even good at following simple instructions to create exactly what people want.

What these people really fear, is the average person no longer needing them to realize their own creative desires. We're talking about the low talent garbage artists that sell their 'skills' for peanuts online to people who are simply poor, cheap, or incapable of drawing and creating on their own. But now, even the most untalented pleb can use their creativity to dream up something interesting and no longer need the bottom feeder hack 'artists' to draw their silly custom birthday cards, posters, character designs for games they will never make, etc.

This drives the bottom feeder artists mad with rage! They no longer get to prey upon the nitwits with disposable income and silly art cravings, because now those people can just make their own silly ideas to their satisfaction with AI.

The major push back against AI art and AI in general is from people who fear their easy or low effort positions being lost. The top artists and producers of creatives have absolutely nothing to fear, and are always going to be in high demand. It's the rat race hustlers and commoditized nobodies who are really in danger, just like the other underachievers that will be replaced by AI and robots.

The sad part is that they rather unnaturally keep the bar low than raise their own selves, much like most of society today where cowards constantly seek to 'level the playing field' by harming the exceptional rather than stepping themselves up. The whole 'social justice' initiative, led by commies and losers. The concept of 'equality' by gimping the exceptional is a trend that MUST die, and I'm glad AI is here to absolutely DESTROY it!",27,14,0.68,2023-04-23 22:19:39,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DefendingAIArt/comments/12wms6q/the_only_artists_who_should_fear_ai_are/,GStreetGames,370

This article sheds light on the challenges of creating predictable AI art, which is a topic not often discussed. Many people assume that creating AI art requires little to no skill, but when it comes to specific results, it can be quite a time-consuming and intricate process.

For instance, if you want to create a particular image, such as a portrait of a friend dressed as the Bride of Frankenstein, holding a cat, in a lab filled with old electronics, you can't just input a prompt and expect the AI to deliver the desired result. It may require a considerable amount of time and expertise to edit prompts and switch between different models to achieve the intended outcome.

While this may not matter to the casual user, it's a crucial skill set for contract artists who need to produce specific AI art for clients. It takes a high level of attention to detail and consistency to achieve predictable results in AI art.",25,27,0.84,2023-04-12 12:08:14,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DefendingAIArt/comments/12jg0ip/how_will_ai_affect_artists/,Lucky-Helicopter-85,160

Yes I'm able to paint photorealistic paintings by a hand, but I always hated the process so I left classical, digital art niche many years ago and started to code my own Generative music softs.

As a person who have good understanding of anatomy and composition I still love to sketch sometimes, but I hate to do details so I really love the idea about generative Ai art.

So I want to get back in to game as a digital artist, but I have some questions about legal issues involving Ai generative art.

1.  As I understand AI-generated work in not copyrightable. Right?

2.  Is it legal to sell Ai-generated art if you don't have copyrights of created artwork.

3.  If it is not copyrightable can I sell Ai-generated art as NFT? Is it legal?

4.  As I understand you can't actually be an Artist if you have no copyrights of created artwork. So by definition ""Ai Artist"" as profession does not exists?

5. ""The US Copyright Office will consider an AI-generated work copyrightable if a human can prove they themselves put a meaningful amount of creative effort into the final content."" - What does it mean?

6.  What if I don't live in US? Can I sell the artwork by simply changing my geolocation? lol

32,DefendingAIArt,13231ix,"Response to the ""How AI Art Works"" infographic","**The infographic in question: https://i.redd.it/qw6v42glvkwa1.png**

The experiment shown in the infographic is a  useless test, this is like training a computer weather model on just two storms and then demonstrating that it predicts those two storms verbatim, and then poorly interpolates between those two storm systems when asked to do anything else. Of course it will essentially reproduce the training data with such a test. But real weather models are taking billions of data points, and actually *modelling* how the data works in a way that generalizes. Same with language and computer vision models.

Even if you believe it is just interpolation, the *best* way to interpolate is for some sort of intelligence to emerge, and to actively avoid blind ""averaging"" techniques that don't work. I believe that neural networks likely produce some sort of higher-level concept web to come to the most efficient way to model the training data. The larger the model, the more human-like the abstractions become, until it is doing something vaguely resembling a human creative process &mdash; although I can't say it's quite there yet.

It's notoriously difficult to peer into the neural network to see if it really has a specific unique insight about the training data, but AI researchers do know how to spot and avoid the problem of neural model over-fitting. The author of this infographic is essentially saying that some combination of over-fitting and simple interpolation is what AI models *always* do, which is patently false.

That being said, I partially agree with one component of the copyright argument this infographic is making, particularly the idea that these can legally be thought of as remixing tools. But remixing tools are not always infringing, and are certainly not unethical just by merit of being a remix. The doctrine of fair use has sided in favor of many remixing methods and tools, because there is an understanding in courts that remixing is an important way we advance culture and art.",12,41,0.87,2023-04-28 20:15:45,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DefendingAIArt/comments/13231ix/response_to_the_how_ai_art_works_infographic/,Booty_Bumping,324

I feel no guilt because I know I am not doing anything wrong. The development of ideas has never been easier, and AI is already making strides in every sector. It is a game-changer. The issue at hand is the replacement of jobs by AI. Humans are highly competent creatures, and they should not be burdened with mundane, repetitive tasks. Why are these still in place? Because it is profitable. The problem lies with the system, not the technology. Repetitive jobs could have already been replaced by machinery long before the AI frenzy. However, the media, which is purchased and sold, aims to generate fear among the public by claiming that AI will take over creative jobs like art and writing when, in fact, they are the very people who belittle these gifted individuals and support the system. This is the epitome of hypocrisy. In my view, AI should make things better. It must be wielded by the right people. It should destroy obsolete work systems and create a better world. Humans are capable of extraordinary things, and we should not be trapped in repetitive tasks that rob us of our potential.

> Any development that gives more people the ability to express themselves in a new way is an exciting one. For every image that displaces a potential low-dollar commission for a working artist, there are countless more that don’t displace anyone’s living—images created by people expressing themselves or adding art to projects that would simply not have been illustrated. Remember: the major impact of automated translation technology wasn’t displacing translators—it was the creation of free and simple ways to read tweets and webpages in other languages when a person would otherwise just not know what was being said.

Infinite Alchemy stands for the seemingly infinite nature of the human imagination and experience and the seemingly infinite possibilities of Artificial Intelligence to enhance, bootstrap, and revolutionise human civilisation, understanding, and wellbeing. The alchemy is in taking the base elements of human experience, AI engineering and technology, and human creativity and forming it into compelling stories that serve as expression for the human experience in a time of rapid and exponentially accelerating technological advancement.

The core output of the magazine is literature. It is not limited to this. Other art forms will be weaved into the fabric of the magazine.  


It aims to challenge the notion that human artists will be displaced, replaced, and overshadowed by AI. At least until AGI proves otherwise, but at that point we have bigger problems than it surpassing us artistically. 

It is fundamentally about using AI as a tool to stretch and expand the human imagination and creative productivity.

41,DefendingAIArt,137xx5y,Legal Defense for Open Source AI,"If an executive order by President Biden or an order from the FTC or similar entity was enacted in the US that would effectively ban Open Source AI, I have been considering what the response to this should look like.  Corporate influence on legislation around AI has very much appeared to align with regulatory capture; restricting the development of open source or free alternatives (and thus the development of competition) to ChatGPT and similar services.

&#x200B;

With all of the options out there, I am feeling more certain than I have in the past that SCOTUS (Supreme Court in the US, where I am a citizen) as terrible as they are in 2023 would rule in opposition and overturn it.

&#x200B;

It is becoming apparent that the Republican party is a bit more open to the idea of keeping AI openly accessible than I first assumed; with the recent use of generative tech by the GOP to make a political attack ad, and some outspoken critics of the RESTRICT act being Republican politicians (Rand Paul and others), I have been surprised to see a positive take on AI from a political party I otherwise vehemently oppose.

&#x200B;

While I don't agree with that ad I mention, and I am completely against pretty much everything the GOP stands for, this still signifies there may be some protections for Open Source software that can be won at the Supreme Court level, considering the extreme partisanship of GOP justices in their alignment to party politics.

&#x200B;

If any good can be extracted from such an otherwise heinously harmful and extremist court, it is imperative that it be pursued, and with mounting pressure from Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI on a Democratic POTUS, with support from openly corrupt politicians like Pelosi and under-informed leaders like Schumer that are objectively unfit to make regulatory decisions on AI or scrutinize corrupt corporate influence on legislation on it, the Open Source community needs an updated short term strategy to address how it is to defend itself from the possibility of extreme and unexpected legal implications.  This should not be a permanent strategy, just a survival plan while AI is able to weather the next few years of grifters and corporate con artists peddling ""fire and brimstone""  AI culture (megacorps like MS/Google/OpenAI preaching the dangers of AI, pushing for restricting open sharing of it, preaching their own unsubstantiated benevolence).

&#x200B;

I don't like pushing fear, but this meeting mentioned in the article here was behind closed doors--no details shared, and only Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and a single startup corporation were invited.  Not one person from the Free Software Foundation, the EFF, or anyone representing the absolutely massive Free and Open Source Software community was given a voice here, and none of these attendees shared details.

&#x200B;

With all of that said, if a drastic decision that harms or destroys the open source sharing of AI/ML models and code is made, the response may need to be a class action lawsuit that escalates up to a SCOTUS ruling on the matter.

&#x200B;

I have no idea how to do this, but I do have many resources available; financial and otherwise, to viably prepare a response like this in the event that the worst case scenario unfolds and the public is stripped of Open Source access to AI related technologies.

&#x200B;

I am going to get some thoughts on this; I plan to email several influential people involved with successful cases that have upheld the GPL license to get advice on what a strategy might look like, and technical detail on the process of filing a lawsuit suit aimed at prompting a SCOTUS response, should the worst case scenario unfold.  I am also going to contact the political group involved with that ai-generated ad I mentioned to vet at least some baseline legitimacy (make sure a investor/producer from an entity that is an military adversary to the US was not involved etc) and if there is potential interest in assisting with funding the preparation of the aforementioned litigation.

&#x200B;

If they are ""clean"" enough on a litigious level then they may be an excellent candidate for helping sponsoring legal costs.  This would be another advertisement for them (which they already fund) and would be incredibly beneficial to uphold constitutional rights on the free exchange of information and protect critical open source technological infrastructure.

42,DefendingAIArt,12ygzbn,Would it be a good idea to create an open source model trained entirely on opt-in data?,"Long post. Please bear  with me... 

Probably the biggest controversy surrounding AI image generators is the fact that they're trained on other people's work, without their consent. It has reached the point that AI users are being demonized over it, being called thrives and whatnot.

And Adobe recently made their own image generator made entirely on licensed images, but people were still up in arms against them, accusing them of using ""sleazy tactics"" to con and Rob the image creators. This kinda shows that the whole copyright controversy is partially just an excuse for artists to call for AI to die. And they'll continue to cling to this until AI ceases to exist.

Anyways, I've gotten an idea that the AI community could begin preparing training a new AI model from scratch. But rather than randomly scraping the data from the internet or from any random database for training , they'll only train with images that were willingly uploaded by the owners/creators who are in support of the technology, want to contribute to make it better, and don't mind the images they upload being used to generate more images. In other words, the data used to train the models will not only be legally ethical, but also perfectly morally so. Since every image used would have the full approval of the creators.

I personally think this could finally kill off the argument that AI images are ""tHeFt"", and shut down any opportunity for the opposes to move the goalposts on what they conceive as ""concept"" in this matter. Maybe this could force them to actually be honest with their true motivations for wanting AI to die, and we could finally have an actual civilized discussion on the REAL potential issues AI could have.

Unfortunately, the resulting model would be inferior to the existing ones we have today. But AI users could use it without having to feel guilty about leeching off other's work. 

Also, this procedure of providing training data could lead to the rise of some new communities dedicated to ethically procuring training images for different styles, scenarios or objects. Like, imagine an online community dedicated to collecting images of HANDS for training the model. Or a community of photographers who spend a fraction of their time taking photos of different subjects for training. Or even just random phone users taking photos of stuff around them and uploading them to the training database. This could generate a large amount of training data and open the anti-AI's eyes to how much support there is for AI.

Anyways that's just my idea on what we could do to ensure an environment where AI doesn't have to be frowned upon. Is it naive? Or could it actually work?",8,3,0.71,2023-04-25 14:47:16,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DefendingAIArt/comments/12ygzbn/would_it_be_a_good_idea_to_create_an_open_source/,Soibi0gn,452

44,DefendingAIArt,12kogoq,Exploring AI Art: Unlocking Creative Potential and Fostering Inclusivity,"As a frequent Reddit user who enjoys engaging in discussions and exploring various topics, I recently came across some interesting subreddits that focus on the use of AI in art. These spaces like rDefendingAIArt, raiwars, and others promote lively discussions, varied opinions and showcase the potential of AI-powered creativity.

AI art has been a contentious topic in recent years with many expressing concern about the impact it may have on traditional artists and the art industry as a whole. However, through my experiences in engaging with these communities, I've come to believe that AI art holds significant potential for enabling new forms of expression and creativity, while also providing artists with tools to enhance their own works.

One thing I've discovered is that AI art can actually help artists break through creative block by offering unique and unexpected perspectives. The use of AI in art has shown that these tools can find associations and generate imagery that might not have occurred to human artists on their own. By automating certain time-consuming tasks, AI art generators can save artists valuable time, allowing them to focus on other aspects of their work.

However, the potential benefits of AI in art extend beyond just assisting established artists. It can also democratize creativity by making it accessible to a wider audience. With AI tools, people who may not have had the resources or ability to create traditional art can now express themselves, share their ideas, and contribute to the artistic landscape. This can foster a more inclusive, diverse, and innovative artistic community.

Of course, with any emerging technology, there are potential concerns and drawbacks. In the case of AI art, one issue is the potential for copyright infringement and the misappropriation of original works. It's important for AI developers, users, and the wider community to remain responsible and vigilant in ensuring that the technology is used ethically and fairly.

Ultimately, AI is just another tool in the artist's toolbox, and as with any other tool, its potential lies in the hands of those who wield it. So long as we continue to have open discussions and encourage responsible, ethical use of AI in art, I believe that its positive impact on creativity and expression could outweigh any potential concerns.

49,aiwars,134qik4,"Why do artists care if other people ""make art"" with a lesser amount of effort?","I've seen this comment frequently in here and other places from traditional artists, and I don't quite get it. 

I understand the economic concerns, and even the concerns around how the models are trained  on their work without their consent, but this reflexive hate against people who use AI image generators because ""they make things quickly and without effort"" seems odd to me.

Don't artists make art for the sake of art? Don't they enjoy the process? We aren't talking about a competition here, its ART! 

I can understand if someone is trying to enter art competitions while trying to pass off AI generations as their own work in a human art category, but that's not the complaints I've really seen. It's basically a hate against AI image generation in any context, even for personal enjoyment.

As someone who has used these tools extensively, I find it to be a new medium that has its own kind of creative process. It is not without effort if you are seeking truly interesting and unique results. Sure, anyone can prompt some pretty basic stuff and get something that looks ""good"", but they all kind of look the same and bland as a result.

I've always enjoyed ""recombination"" in my creative works, whether it was using photoshop to combine different elements together to create new compositions, making remixes of different tracks, etc. AI is the most powerful recombination tool in history, and that's why I find it exciting. It can help us make connections and remixes that would otherwise never come to be.

I'd never compare it to spending multiple hours rendering a detailed digital portrait or oil painting by hand, but it's still a creative endeavor, IMO.

But even if it weren't, why should it matter to me if someone else is using a tool to bring their ideas to life in a way that requires less effort if I enjoy whatever creative process I'm doing to bring mine to life?

It just seems to be something that is coming out of a place of ego and resentment, and rather petty.

I'll draw a parallel to something outside of the art world. 

Imagine a skateboarder being upset that electric skateboarders are riding in the streets because it's ""low effort skateboarding"".

54,aiwars,139g0na,"For those who hold a negative stance toward AI, I would like to pose a question to you. Would you still consider someone an artist if they have been creating art for years, but have recently incorporated AI into their creative process?","Edit: I know the percentage of anti-AI people is low and that the average person is neutral or positive toward AI art. I'm just curious to see what anti-AI people think.

I know this is a bit long, but hopefully, this helps people understand how AI could be used as a tool and assist you in making your art. You could also make beautiful concepts with AI and actually make them have ""emotion"" and ""soul"", as most anti-ai people don't like to believe.

So, I've been creating art for years since when I was in my teens as a means to heal from my childhood trauma, and now as a hobby. I usually like to make photobashed art using Photoshop/Illustrator. I've only recently gotten into creating AI art after being against it for a good year. I wasn’t able to create art for a good while, at least 2 years, because I work as a vaccine developer as my day job so my time has become very limited. Trust me when I say it was starting to make me depressed because I create art as a way to relax and calm myself from my anxieties/depression. Not being able to create anything for at least 2 years was really making me question whether or not I loved my job and if I should even work there because not being able to make art was affecting my mental health.

My journey with Photoshop/Illustrator started when I was creating 3D clothing for my simulation games and learned how to use it to create textures for my models. As I became more skilled, I realized that I could use these skills to create art. I began with a piece called ""Chained Memories,"" which was a combination of 3D modeling and editing in Photoshop/Illustrator. From there, I learned how to photobash using Photoshop/Illustrator to create unique pieces.

I started reading more about AI and decided to give it a try, and honestly, I was in awe. I would use my old art and sketches as references to train my AI, and it was able to get down my vision exactly like I imagined it in my head, and not only that, but it would sometimes give me variations and lead me to a whole new path from what I originally wanted to create. Now, I use AI as a tool to assist me in my creative process. I'm not the type to generate pictures and just slap my name on it. I still spend 10+ hours on my pieces.

My boyfriend is a traditional artist who paints with his hands and was also against the usage of AI for a good while as well, until I convinced him to experiment with using AI with me. He too saw the possibilities and how it could help him. For him, he uses it whenever he feels like he has artist's block and has a hard time putting his ideas together to create a cohesive piece. He doesn't paint exactly what the AI gives him, but it will give him new ideas and help him figure out how to better organize all the shapes, characters, etc. to create a cohesive painting.

After putting a lot of time and effort into editing, my final product may look vastly different from the AI-generated images that served as my inspiration. However, like any other form of art, people can find inspiration in the work of others and create their own pieces based on that style. Although the resulting artwork may have differences, you can still see the influence of the original artist. For instance, I have a deep admiration for Monet and Klimt, and I find that AI is particularly effective at creating impressionist art due to the random patterns it generates.

I believe you still need skills in order to use AI efficiently because text2image is not very good at putting ideas together, in my opinion, or at least my ideas. I have to input my own sketches as references in order for it to finally give me something that I want and am able to work with. Previously, it was commonplace for individuals to acknowledge the influence of certain artists in others' work. However, with the rise of AI, if an image resembles the style of another artist, people are quick to accuse it of theft, disregarding the fact that it is only the style that appears similar.

Imagine, if you will, a handmade painting of an elephant in the style of the great Van Gogh, resembling his iconic Starry Night, and it looks like Van Gogh could've probably painted it himself. However, it must be noted that Van Gogh has never portrayed an elephant in his unique style. In such a scenario, would the creation of the elephant piece be deemed theft? It is important to recognize that this unique creation of the elephant would not have come to existence without the artist's contribution and innovation.

A quick summary of an example of how I've recently started making my art with the assistance of AI:

1. First, I input my old art or my rough sketches into the program and use simpler prompts and fewer steps to generate the image to save time on computation. I prioritize quantity over quality and choose the desired color and style later.
2. Since the generated image is close to what I want, but of course since it's AI, the facial features are rough, and there tends to be an extra hand or oddly shaped hands, that I can't remove with prompt tweaking alone. So, I then take the image to Photoshop for the first round of touch-ups and add/remove details.
3. With the overall composition confirmed, I continue adjusting the prompts while testing different models. Since different models excel in different areas, I need to try multiple options before finding the one that can provide more intricate details for the current image. I increase the number of steps and resolution for more detailed results, which takes more time, so I usually run several images at once while doing something else.
4. Then, I switch between 2-4 different variations, adjusting their weights until I find the desired facial features and shape. I can make adjustments to the model at the same time in Photoshop or Illustrator, or I can finalize the model first and then fine-tune it.
5. Once everything is completely finished, I like to go over it using neural filters and correct my picture using ""camera raw filter"" in Photoshop without any further AI generation. From this point on, it's just my own skills in Photoshop/Illustrator. I will add/change details such as changing colors, adding/removing patterns, adding aspects to the background, adding emotion to the piece by adding emotion to my characters' faces, fixing the hands, feet, face, etc. by drawing in my own hands, face, feet, fingers, toes, etc.
6. Finally, once all the changes are complete and the image looks cohesive. I will go in for a last round of final touches, such as lighting, shading, highlights, etc.

Also, those who believe that AI can't be used to make concept art because of the generated randomness is wrong. That's all I ever create: concept art. All of my art has meaning. For example [https://ibb.co/9Y1wzCY](https://ibb.co/9Y1wzCY)

The picture on the left is the AI-generated image I created using my sketch as a reference and used the generated image as my inspiration. The one on the right is my final product. For the concept of this piece, I wanted to create science art representing DNA and the connection of life on earth, and how DNA is the base of life. The inspiration for the clear globe and the mountains on the bottom was a snow globe. I wanted a way to include the earth or represent the earth but I didn’t want to be too literal and add planet earth. So I decided to metaphorically represent the earth with the clear globe with many plants and butterflies. The DNA is made of flowers and my inspiration for this was “the tree of life”. I included the moon to let my audience know that the sphere surrounded by flowers and butterflies is supposed to represent the Earth. I used mountains as a holder for my “snow globe” to further insinuate that the picture represents the earth and life on earth.",28,15,0.82,2023-05-06 10:41:36,,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/139g0na/for_those_who_hold_a_negative_stance_toward_ai_i/,Boshokie,1381
57,aiwars,12owzyn,The 'Artist Mindset': Why I think there is current bloodshed between anti-AI art and pro-AI art people,"Basing thing on a discussion in a different AI related post, here's how I see what's happening:

Say the art community is a discord server. It has its own rules and channels for different mediums of art e.g. painting, drawing, sketching ,digital and channels by medium like oil paint, acrylic, water color, graphite, charcoal, pen & ink, etc. The photography community is also its own discord server with its own set of rules and channels. Now here is the AI art community who's come into the space of (mostly) the art discord server. They see the digital channel and post content in it...and then the bloodshed starts.

Why is there discord when both digital and AI art are both 'digital' mediums of art?

As I've listed in the channel examples, mediums are segregated within the art community based on tools and processes and combinations of a lot of things. But notice that all of the mediums that fall under the art community involve creating something by drawing a piece of art by hand. Photography does not draw anything by hand, so it is its own community, but is no less creative than what falls under the art community. Personally, I also don't think AI art is any less creative (though I acknowledge all the issues going around it), but I still believe that it falls under it's own category separate from the current 'digital' art medium.

But why? Aren't they all 'digital'? Isn't art and photography just 'art'?  Well, this is where the Artist Mindset comes in.

This way of thinking, generalizing all of these mediums into a single word to describe everything is true **outside of the artist community**, but they matter **within** the community. Painters won't just generalize a photo as a painting and vice-versa. This is why a lot of the current digital artists also react negatively to AI art being passed off as 'digital' art. It is a different type of tool and a different process. The current digital art space have artists work on their art majority by hand. AI does not.

This is my own hot take, but if the AI art community wants to integrate itself within the current art space, they need to understand and accept that their is in fact an 'Artist Mindset' within the art community. You call your AI art 'art', which means you are saying you are in the art space now. Start thinking like an artist if you want to be acknowledged as one, and stop passing off your AI art as 'digital' art. Understand some of the rules and don't just ignore everything that has been established before. They are two different mediums. It may not solve anything, but I think it's still important.

PS: Regarding the 'this is art theft' and the 'this is transformative work' debate, there is already enough discussion going around about that so this post isn't about it.

58,aiwars,12o2aut,Can you explain how you justify using the likeness of artists work for AI generated art?,"I'd like to really have a conversation about this because the *only* argument I hear in defense of using the likeness of human artists is that human artists are apparently worthless trash that don't deserve anything. It doesn't paint a very nice picture of people who defend AI art if they have no human decency and no insight into the process of making art.

Using the likeness would be specifying their name in a prompt to fish out a style which I assume you're all aware works, or using a checkpoint or LoRA or embedding or whatever additional methods there are to achieve a particular style of art.

I will have to read more responses at another time, but I'm obviously curious where people stand on this and I'm glad we could have this conversation in a civilized manner.

I am pro-AI, I incorporate AI in some of my work. I'm a university graduate in IT and Programming, specialized in software engineering, and also a university graduate in Digital Art, specialized in concept art. Art is my career (for now.)

I am not discussing whether or not it is illegal to copy the likeness of an artist's style, I'm discussing what we feel about that and if we should protect an artist's right to the style they have cultivated to create a demand for their art.",207,9,0.61,2023-04-16 12:15:05,,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/12o2aut/can_you_explain_how_you_justify_using_the/,linuxlut,268
60,aiwars,13448r7,I'm a comic artist - How might my future look like?,"Hey there! I'm neither strongly Pro nor Anti AI, but I'm very curious as to how this developing technology could affect my career as well as for other comic artists.

A bit about me: I'm a comic artist who works part time for now, but am slowly growing my income to try to make it full time. I've had a lot of experience in both art and comp sci, but I've chosen to go with art because while it's more unreliable, it's personally the more enjoyable out of the two. If my art career becomes irrelevant, I can always go into a different field and while I'd be saddened to lose a great career, I'd still like a career in the field of computer science. I find AI art to be fascinating and a great tool to use for brainstorming and for fun. I'm still unsure about the ethicality of it, but regardless it's likely going to stay for the future.

Personally, I think that unlike illustration, comic artists have a lot more likely chance of not being largely replaced due to the need for comics to look constantly consistent in its overall style. I've even tried an experiment of incorporating the AI into my workflow, but honestly it didn't help that much other than with the background. But even with the background, I found it much easier to create most of it from scratch! Of course, that's not to say that no AI comics will exist in the future. I've seen it done a few times and sometimes it looks bad, but sometimes it looks very well made.

A realization I've made that I haven't heard many people say before about art is that after a certain point of skill, the quality doesn't matter as much as the concept. The main reason that people follow my art accounts because they like my unique ideas. I'm thinking that perhaps it's because of the fact that I have those unique ideas + a unique style that my career may be able to last for the forseeable future.

Anyways, there's a lot of interesting people on this subreddit and I'm very curious to hear about what people think about how the future might be like for people like me.

63,aiwars,12qxljv,On The Defensiveness of AI Artists,"tl;dr Because we want to feel that small spark of happiness from having created something without being shit on by people we have done no wrong to.

Something I have noticed as an AI art creator and a participant in AI art spaces is that we feel a sense of accomplishment and happiness that comes from having created something that didn't exist before. Even the most basic and simple AI creations can have this effect, particularly for people new to the community or to creative endeavors altogether. As someone who has little traditional skill in visual arts and limited time and talent to learn them, I feel a great deal of satisfaction in creating something that I set out to create. Sure, I can put in 'oil painting of a cat, greg rutkowski' and get something that brings a smile to my face but the real work of getting an image to match what is in my head, even when it is simplified by AI, feels like something real and worth sharing with others.

Much of the anger and defensiveness of the pro-AI community seems to come from being denied these simple pleasures. Some, of course, would take it too far and claim to be on par with a real artist whose skills have taken a lifetime to hone and who possesses a rare natural talent, but most of us aren't seeking that kind of recognition. I have found myself the target of barbed insults and personal attacks for sharing AI art creations that have resulted in real pain and depression, despite my rather tough and resilient ego, and these feelings are the root of extremism and factionalism. I've never sought any recognition as an artist or any money for my creations, all I seek is someone saying 'hey, that looks cool' and I am often treated as though I'm robbing my artistic heroes at gunpoint by people who seem to be lashing out at their helplessness to change the fact that AI art is here to stay and it makes cool images, usually better than what its critics can make. I'm not posting my creations in spaces like ""Hand-Made Paintings"", that would be an obvious problem that would justify a negative response, but in places that allow copy-paste of other peoples art and screenshots of tweets.

Ai art critics, and I would include myself among them in many ways, would do better to address real issues like whether pay services such as Midjourney should be forced to pay the artists whose work they are profiting from or supporting an opt-out for artists who do not want to be included in a pay sites database.

While I do see most of the pro Ai users out there having reasonable discourse, it seems like there are a quite a few out there who just seem angry at artists as a whole and want to see their field of expertise become obsolete. Let it be clear, I’m not talking about the people who are criticizing some of the ridiculous behavior of certain artists, rather I’m asking about the people who seem to hate artists for being artists.
Now, I understand that when it comes to any controversial topic there will be idiots and screamers on both sides. 
I’m no stranger to artists being unreasonable, emotional and demanding when it comes to the topic of Ai, but at least I understand why— for many it feels like not just their careers, but their hopes and dreams are being taken away in front of their very eyes. 
But what have artists done to these haters to make them so angry? I just don’t get it.

Another somewhat related question is: why are so many people so eager to replace artists and not some of the more mundane hated jobs in the world? I would think replacing people’s creative endeavors would be the last thing you’d want to replace (ex. Ai replaces humans for 95% of the easy, mundane jobs allowing people to pursue their passions, aka careers that involve, novel, interesting, and complex problems that require creativity to solve).",78,19,0.74,2023-04-16 05:40:39,,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/12ns57s/why_are_some_people_so_eager_to_replace_non_ai/,YamammyX,324
70,aiwars,135cq66,"When I say, ""artist,"" this is what I mean...","We get into some silly arguments here about who is and is not an artist.

Let's try to clear that air.

""Artist"" isn't just a self-identified label like, ""religious,"" where you can say, ""I'm religious,"" without any real agreement with anyone else who is religious on what that word means. Artist is several things: a profession, a cultural identification, a token of recognition by one's peers, etc.

But I think that at its heart, we can define artist without excluding anyone unduly and without broadening the word so much as to make it useless.

So there are five words that are key to my definition:

* Communication - Just like it sounds: some form of communicating ideas, feelings, experiences, states of mind, etc.
* Symbolic - Symbolic interactions are those that occur through the medium of symbols. That is, any interaction that carries some subtextual content alluded to through symbolism. Symbols thus provide additional meaning that is not directly within the literal mode of the interaction.
* Intentionality - This is pretty self-explanatory. If you accidentally step in wet concrete someone might consider the resulting footprint ""art"" which is fine, but it's hard to say that you are an ""artist"" as you did not intend to create that art.
* Consistency - Like it says on the tin. Not a one-time thing. Maybe rare. Maybe only for a year, but not a one-off.
* Audience - Not necessarily a literal audience, but some person or group that you intend your communication to reach. There's even a sense in which the intended audience can be yourself, but there cant' be *no audience*.

Okay, so let's put this together:

> To be an artist, one must engage in symbolic communication to an audience with intentionality and consistency

Without symbolism you don't have the contextual weight that makes something into art. A rock is just a rock, but if you use the rock as a symbol it can become art without any physical transformation at all.

Without communication your potential art is inert. Communication is the fundamental physics of art.

Without an audience, you aren't actually communicating. That audience might be an abstraction, an idea of those you wish to communicate with, but it has to be some target that your communication is aimed at.

Without intentionality, you're the person walking through wed concrete. You might turn it into art. You can bring that intentionality after the fact by promoting a symbolic ""wrapper"" around your unintentional act, but that's an artistic act that is happening after the initial creation of the thing you're calling art.

Without consistency, art is still art. But profession words like artist, programmer, miner and hunter imply that this is a pattern, not just an event; that this is a thing that you do in practice.

Notice that nowhere in this definition is there anything to do with the infamous ""picking up a pencil."" Nor is there any mention of specific tools like AI.

Arguments against this view:

* I think consistency is the weakest element here, and depends on how you view the whole class of profession words like ""doctor"" and ""dancer"".
* You could attack this on the basis of its implicit definition of art, but that definition is specifically so broad as to be a superset of at least most of the various definitions you can find. Ultimately, I'm asserting that art is symbolic communication with an audience, which you can take to mean so much that I don't think it's very easy to undermine it.
* You could try to claim that this is a proscriptive restriction on something that can't be restricted, but again the definition is so broad that it's hard to find where it is restricting anyone's identification as an artist without some pretty obvious merit.
* You could go the other way and say that this definition is so broad that it borders on meaningless. But then I've given some pretty clear examples of those who fall outside of the scope of the definition.

75,aiwars,12uqk5m,Examples of incorporating AI in an artist's workflow,"I saw another post about this, but felt it was far from the mark. I'm not going to pretend I have tips that will work for everyone, and I bet there's tips in other subs than this one. But given that I've been talking to people who understand very little of *my* workflow on this sub, I figured it might enlighten some of the AI people who suggest AI as a tool for artists. And also be some suggestions for fellow artists.

*Edit: A little clarification before I waste your time reading something that doesn't apply to you. This is all* ***Stable Diffusion***, *I have not used Midjourney or other popular AI services and don't know if any of this is possible with those. I know someone who uses Midjourney, but it is certainly a case of the AI doing literally everything and doesn't seem like a good tool for steps in the workflow of an artist.*

*I also went over the post to clarify that some of these methods are a grey area in terms of law and would not combine well with professional work. I'd also like to add while I have your attention that crutches stifle growth and relying heavily on AI will make you a worse artist, you have to take responsibility for your own actions.*

I'll try to take this step by step by explaining what I would normally do, and how I can do it with AI after.

>Artist: A client has a request for a particular subject, every single job starts with this, the client can be a boss or a commissioner or myself. My first job as someone who translates ideas to paper is to understand the idea, so I will find out more about this particular subject by asking questions and doing research. I'll be looking for things that I can use visually to create this character and not a generic character. Many of the things I discover I will then find references for so I can accurately depict them.

AI: With AI I can sometimes generate these references instead of searching for them, while Google search is quick and usually on point, it doesn't always give me what I'm looking for. AI can take multiple different prompts better than a Google search, and can spit out 4 images per second, making it likely that in a minute I will have something of use. I generate armor and clothing, streets, haircuts, tattoos, interiors, character interactions, and so on. I don't use it directly, it just helps me in my work to see where I'm heading and I can use the elements I like. It can also randomly understand a prompt differently than I thought it would and provide a new perspective I hadn't thought about. I'd call this incorporating AI in the research and inspiration phase, it's a quick but sometimes less in-depth and accurate way to do it.

>Artist: With my references and notes for the subject done, I move on to the canvas and sketch out ideas, I focus on shapes here trying to capture a personality and vibe, while creating something visually interesting and appealing. This is called thumbnailing and consists of dozens or hundreds of very low detail sketches that take a short time to create.

AI: I can prompt AI with my ideas and see what it spits out as well, but usually this doesn't yield good results. Something I do benefit from in my workflow is throwing my thumbnails into ControlNet and having the AI generate things based on my prompt within the shape of my thumbnail. I have aphantasia so for me it helps to see if my silhouette can work. As any artist will tell you a thumbnail can go in a million different directions. Letting the AI send it in a million different directions while I grab a cup of tea and clear my mind can help speed up my work. It will not explore all the directions I would've thought of given some time, but thinking them up and sketching them out would cost a lot of time, and it might go in directions I didn't expect.

>Artist: Now that thumbnails and sketches have been created I will select which ones to commit to developing more, and I'll likely start incorporating some of the references I found earlier directly. For this step the goal is to make something that I could show my client and they will understand what's happening on the canvas. That means this iteration has to communicate everything the final piece communicates, but with as little effort as possible. In my case, this is the part that takes the longest time and is also what I enjoy the least in my art. For me, I have seen what I want from the thumbnail with a rough sketch over it, and I want to move on to a new project.

AI: Sadly, so far I haven't seen much use of AI for the difficult part of this step, namely drawing the owl from two circles. What AI does help with, on the other hand, is render a final sketch that's done cleanly into a practically finished rendering. This is something I would never waste time on doing manually before something is approved, but with AI I can have it generate variations in high resolution that tell the client more than just my lines and this seems to help for the client. This is useful to me because I will have less things to correct later if the client understands better what the end result will be without telling me to change course.

>Artist: With an approved detailed sketch my job is to render it so that it can go to another step in production or home to a client or be uploaded to my portfolio. This is another time-consuming process that I find meditative, but not important to me personally, and automation would be welcome to increase throughput. This involves flat colors, probably a lot of selection tool or precise brush work, values, details and so on. The benefit for me is that this is mostly autopilot, the problem is I can spend a day instead of starting on a new project which is where I excel.

AI: If accuracy and quality isn't of utmost importance here, letting the AI loop over and over in img2img from the pseudo rendered piece in the previous step that was approved can lead to a decently rendered final piece, depending on how unique the style is that you're going for. I have to go over it to fix errors in perspective and proportions, but it gets an okay result. I don't like doing this because I like having control of the final step, and actually going in and reclaiming the art as my own would take longer than just making it my own from the previous step. This feels like the most controversial step to use AI for, but I think there's a lot of phenomenal sketch artists out there who could branch out to rendered paintings with a tool like this. A warning that this process, even if you paint over details and fix errors by hand after, will most likely *void any copyright* to the final image.

\-

Bonus use-cases:

Generating backgrounds for artists who don't have the time or the skill to make backgrounds at the same level as their foreground subject. Be aware that legally this may void copyright.

Generating realistic human faces that aren't real people. I make semirealistic to photorealistic characters often, and to do that with aphantasia I have to use detailed photo references religiously. Sometimes it's not a good idea for the fantasy character to look like a real person people recognize. AI has potential here to make anonymous realistic faces without you having to be a creep yourself and download images from small social media accounts. I don't condone the collection of basically private photos of random people on the internet just because those people were gullible and posted them online, but they do add much needed variety to face generation. To be perfectly clear here, I generate the photorealistic face and use it as a reference the same way I would use a photograph, I paint the face for my artwork manually. The benefit is that the result doesn't look like a famous person, but still looks realistic.

Cleaning up sketches. Sometimes you made a sketch that has strange proportions, missing details and the lines were particularly unsteady. Feeding this sketch to the AI via img2img can clean up the lines while staying true to the original sketch. It will create artefacts, but it can help a long way with cleaning up a messy sketch. But AI people need to invent transparent backgrounds in generations for this to truly be useful because nobody wants the white background merged with their sketch.

Faces on characters. A little hit or miss for me, but if you struggle with faces for characters at a bit of a distance, instead make the head shape and throw it into the Inpainting tool and mask out the face. Then generate a face. Give it a few generations to make one that fits the composition and angle, and then paint it into the rest if it's standing out. Not sure how this would affect copyright. As a concept artist the normal practice for this if the work isn't going to be published is to copypaste purchased stock photo and blend it in. Inpainting is faster, but may not be good from the legal perspective.",12,16,0.81,2023-04-22 04:47:19,,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/12uqk5m/examples_of_incorporating_ai_in_an_artists/,linuxlut,1588

82,aiwars,12ku0mf,"Why AI art isn't (yet) ""art"" and why artists who use AI art software are no less artists","Just looking for a pretty picture? TL;DR: https://i.imgur.com/YsArMi8.png

Want a summary of this argument? TL;DR: AI art models aren't (yet) artists because they don't convey their own abstract or symbolic concepts, only that of the prompter. But in the future (perhaps today depending on how you feel about the example below) they could be, by deciding what sorts of ideas should be conveyed and generating their own prompting.

## What Is ""Art""?

There are as many definitions of the word ""art"" as there are of other ill-defined terms like ""religion"" or ""love"". But I'm going to lean on a very technical definition of the role that art serves in this post:

> art *n.* any expression through some medium (be it language, behavior or a physical creation) that serves to communicate a symbolic or abstract concept, state of mind, feeling or experience to an intended audience.

So there are a few key points there. For example, this post isn't ""art"" by this definition because it isn't communicating a ""symbolic or abstract concept,"" instead it's communicating a literal and concrete set of concepts.

## Are Models Artists?

So what about AI art models? These take in a prompt and map that prompt to an image. So it makes sense to try to argue that it's meeting the definition. It's taking an abstract concept represented by a prompt and producing an expression of it in visual form.

That's misleading. The process there is simply translation. There's no expression being communicated that wasn't already present. Similarly, a security camera that captures a 2D image of a sculpture in a museum isn't art either, even though the image might convey the same concepts as the sculpture. That's because the ""art"" in question is the sculpture and how you view it is irrelevant.

In AI art programs, the art is the prompt. That's what contains the symbolic or abstract concept that the artist (the human) wishes to convey. Translation to an image is not the artistic component, even though it involves the use of artistic *techniques*.

## How Can Models Become Artists?

The question of where the symbolic or abstract ideas come from is difficult. Is a person who makes a drawing of a character from anime creating ""art"" or are they just translating from one medium to another? There's no one-size-fits-all answer there. Some people inject their own ideas into that process and thus meet the criteria. Some people trace over an existing still from media which you could argue both ways: perhaps they are trying to convey the feeling they experienced when watching that media, and the artistic element was the selection of a particular still that conveyed that meaning. Maybe they're just acting very mechanically to produce what their audience wants.

So a model that takes in a prompt and produces an image through a partially random and partially mechanical process of mapping the prompt to a mathematical space of images isn't art by this definition, but the output is art in the sense that it conveys the source art, the prompt. What if the AI produced the prompt?

As an example, I asked ChatGPT to produce a prompt, but instead of asking for a prompt for a specific idea, I asked, ""Could you produce a prompt for an AI art program such as Stable Diffusion that conveys your symbolic or abstract ideas?"" Its response was:

> Create an abstract representation of the concept of ""infinity."" Use a palette of blues and purples to evoke a sense of depth and vastness. Incorporate geometric shapes that repeat and overlap in a never-ending pattern to symbolize the infinite nature of the concept. Experiment with different levels of transparency and opacity to create a sense of layers and complexity. Finally, include a focal point in the center of the composition that represents the ultimate endpoint of the infinite cycle, but also the beginning of the next iteration.

When given to Stable Diffusion (using the base 1.5 model) it generated [this image](https://i.imgur.com/YsArMi8.png). This image did not come from me. I didn't specify anything about it other than the requirement that it must convey a symbolic or abstract idea. So it's art?

Certainly I'd say that if the AI decides, unprompted, to produce something like this, that it counts as art. But we could view this particular prompt as just an ""average"" response to the sort of question I asked.

I think that this is firmly in the middle of the road. It's not ""clearly art"" but it's also not possible to say that it's not, definitively.

## Human Artists

No matter what, the people who use AI art programs to convey their own symbolic or abstract ideas, no matter how primitive or refined those ideas might be, are artists. They are doing the thing we've defined above as art.

This becomes even more true when we talk about more sophisticated workflows than simply prompting an AI model. AI artists often have long and complex workflows that involve sketching, prompting, refining and iterating, prompt interrogation, pose / scene control, inpaiting, and the use of non-AI tools at several of these stages. All of these activities are in service of the human artist's desire to convey symbolic or abstract ideas to their audience.

## Conclusion

AI image generation models today are not artists. They are tools that artists can use. AI in the future (or perhaps current AI text generation models in conjunction with AI image generators) could be considered artists, but the jury is still out on when that will happen.

No matter what, we cannot deny that the artist who happens to use AI tools in the conveyance of a symbolic or abstract concept is just as much an artist as one who uses paint or photography or prose or collage.",18,0,0.5,2023-04-13 19:04:34,,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/12ku0mf/why_ai_art_isnt_yet_art_and_why_artists_who_use/,Tyler_Zoro,942
83,aiwars,12mjvs0,"AI will EXPAND opportunities for artists, not reduce them.","Typically in art history, people first try to use new tools to essentially reproduce old media. Thus the first oil paintings attempted to recreate egg tempera frescoes. The first photographs attempted to look like painted portraits. And television started out basically as radio with pictures.

Eventually creative people figure out that the new tools create opportunities for entirely new arenas of expression that weren't possible in the old media. Oil painting makes Flemish realism possible; photography makes it possible to document construction workers on the Empire State building; and television allows forms of visual storytelling that would have been impossible on radio.

Right now, AI is mostly being used to create artifacts that we are used to seeing: still images for online use, short ""movies"", music videos, etc. Things will really get exciting when entirely new forms begin to emerge, and artists will--or could if they choose--be at the forefront of that.

1. I think it's emblematic of the way we're automating all the wrong things, and eroding opportunity and creative expression for some of the already most underpaid members of society (artists), all to pursue theoretical gains that would be best siloed off into academic labs rather than released into the wild west of the Internet.

2. I think it discourages new artists from learning, by deflating the value of learning these hard-earned skills. Validation and encouragement is important when you're learning, for better or for worse. The sense that technical virtuosity and artistic skill have been automated is deeply discouraging, deeply depressing for people investing the necessary years into honing their talents. When work better than yours can be generated in milliseconds, by the thousands, it makes you think, ""What's the point?"" If no new artists set out on this path, I think we'll only become more creatively bankrupt.

People have their own viewson this issue and they're fully entitled to their own opinon. Some people think that only human artists should be in the art world, that's perfectly okay. I don't see the issue with people making funny memes with Stable Diffusion as a joke or whacking it to AI generated big booba anime waifus. Its just people having fun with it.

87,aiwars,12w119k,"Have you been trained on? If so, StableDiffusion still doesn't know your art exists.","Stable Diffusion has about 1 byte of stored information for every image in the training set. I went over duplicated items in a much longer more math-y post but suffice to say duplication isn't all that relevant to the general conclusion for the case of LAION-5B.

SD knows about as much information about each individual image as knowing one or two letters of a book. It isn't capable of remembering enough information to distinguish your image from several hundred thousand others. Like about 1 subpixel or half of a single token of information is what it internalizes from an image.

This means it is very good at memorizing broad stylistic tendencies of large groups or highly prominent artists, but certainly doesn't have any way to regurgitate even one single bit of unique information about an average individual image in the LAION-5B set.

The main threat from AI art is not from overfitting to memorize or copy images, which it does rarely and which AI companies deliberately try to avoid, or potential copyright infringement that can result, but from the automation competitive threat to artists merely by the technology existing. This threat still exists as long as there are trainable images out there in large numbers that constitute a representative sample, regardless of whether they are yours in particular.",165,28,0.81,2023-04-23 11:18:21,,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/12w119k/have_you_been_trained_on_if_so_stablediffusion/,pds314,215
88,aiwars,137knn1,AI art as a third category of art?,"Hi! Artist here, I used to be a lot more negative towards AI art, but I've warmed up to the tech somewhat and now consider myself neutral-to-cautiously-optimistic. I think it can open a lot of new creative pathways for people and act as a powerful tool for artists. I'm still wary of the potential for exploitation (such as artists being laid off because AI is cheaper and companies want to cut costs), but that's more of an issue with late-stage capitalism than the tech itself.

My question for both sides: would you consider a future where the stigma against AI art is removed *but* it's considered a third category of art alongside digital/traditional art a good (or ideal) one? Just like how an oil painting, a photograph and a digital illustration all have different unique qualities but are still considered art, I think a lot of the fears around AI art would be lessened if it was widely treated not as a direct competitor to digital artists, but a different medium with a different creative process. (I'm talking about primarily AI-generated works. Just like artists inking in pencil then coloring digitally, I'd consider digital artists making substantial use of AI in their creative process mixed media artists.)

I'm aware that with the current state of the AI debate we can't achieve this for now, but I'm curious whether people would be happy with this view of AI art if there were no stigma around labeling it as such.

90,aiwars,132mw9s,I don't really hear any of this getting discussed and I'm just tired of the same monotony,"Out of the gate, I will fully disclose for all personal bias that I am an artist pursuing an education, so if that helps contextualize where this sentiment comes from there ya go. This is more of a rant thread so I can just verbally scream into the void rather than an open invitation to debate so- lay into it lmao.

First and foremost, in relevance to art, my concern isn't that it's ethical or not. I like to do as little harm to others as I can throughout life, but I also don't consider myself an ethically good person. My clothes and product are made on the back of sweatshops, the meat I consume is harvested by horrific means. I am in no position to virtue signal others.

One thing I am tired of infinitely having to entertain in conversation with my programmer friends is the validity of what they're doing. Yes. It is art. People get stun-locked on this point like all art produced within the world is ephemeral and reaches towards divinity when that isn't the case at all. Don't get me wrong, I really do believe in the power of art, otherwise I wouldn't still be alive. I'm so fucking bored with the world that it's the only way I can contextualize it that gives it any amount of endearing characteristic anymore. Art can transcend and be representative of great thought, on numerous occasions I've witnessed it and it's completed shifted my position of something, reconceptualized the way I see the entirety of everything. But this is not a quality that is shared by all art. Art that is made by children is charming and endearing. Art made by beginners is encouraging and emboldening. Art by masters is profound. But this is where I have my problem, it was actually *made* by them. 

There's no doubt that you actually make your pictures by putting in prompts, editing them, even the more bold choosing to paint over it to try and get the ai to recognize what it is you want. But even in the most extreme cases, it's so lacking. Art is a paradox where to paraphrase the street artist painter duo Herakut, if you're thinking about what you're doing- you're doing it wrong. But at the same time each project, each creation is made by thousands of individual decisions. When I make a drawing and I choose what I want from it, I cannot emphasize the intimate level of management between gesture, contrast, light and form, in general the composition, and the way that this all gets entangled with what are referred to as the fundamentals of making art like perspective, anatomy, light and color, etc. When I am able to sit down in a gallery and earnestly look at a piece of abstract art and meditate on it for 10, 15 minutes, it doesn't really matter if it was made by a master or by a beginner, old man or child. Because that final picture is wholly theirs and theirs only. When I look at a painting I can identify individual thoughts and brush strokes, I can see the struggle, the joy, I can feel the environment that they immersed it in. I can feel what they felt successful in, and I can partly feel what they wish they had the skill to do- and it's so human. 

This is ultimately where I have a problem with ai art. It doesn't matter if by advancement of its models that it can eventually learn to trick me into thinking its an original work, because the sentiment is all the same. The moment I realize there was no actual thought put into it, my joy is taken away. Imagine your child coming to you on your birthday and handing you a card that they made for you, how much it means that they themselves made it, doesn't matter if it's shit or not, they made it with a purpose. When you try to measure the quality of ai art on the metric of whether or not it can trick someone into thinking it's a human work, you're running a fools errand. That's the moment where the teacher calls you and tells you that you're child didn't actually draw that birthday card for you, they stole it out of someone else's backpack. 

Hands be damned, fucked up anatomy, lack of consistent detail, motif, or compositional strength, the way I can always be certain I see an ai work before I check the tags is by whether or not it bores me to a level that I know that no human actually wanted it to exist.

I'm not trying to deprive anyone of their joy. I'm really not. If you want a pretty picture- please get one. Get your steampunk pretty woman art station KIKI+> whenever you want. If anything at a very basic level within the field of freelance artist's, ai art is a relief. As it means that no longer will you have some moron in your dm's telling you about his great idea for a game, and how he just needs you to do 60 hours of making assets for him for your name in the credits, or more commonly a 30 follower musician on Sound Cloud telling you that somehow it's your moral obligation to provide him an album cover. These are the lowest paying customers and I'll be happy if they can just find a means to an end without harassing some poor 14 year old on Twitter. 

If anyone is still hung-up on the ethical standing of it, it's time to grow up on both parts and accept what's happening. There's no need in playing coy if you're sampling 'Trevor Henderson Artstation trending soft shading no watermark' that you're literally just phoning it in over the labor of a living artist. I am sincerely tired of stumbling across the posts of some moron trying to sell prints of his ugly ai generated t-shirts, and seeing three lobotomites in their comments going *ERM ARE YOU OKAY WITH SCHTEALLIING THAT*. Yeah, they are, dumbass. 

And I'm so tired of the borrowed opinion of 'art=rich person tax write-off'. Yes, it happens. But I think you need to get your frontal cortex checked if you think that the person making concept art for a Blizzard game and getting fondled by their bosses are the same people selling some work called 'My Sadness' depicting a lonely immigrant child in front of an empty plate. The whole notion of artists somehow being monetarily incentivized is ironically rich considering how much of a notoriously pained path in life it is, and the fact that if I go onto Youtube at any given moment without an account and search 'AI art' all I get are people debating the ethical quandaries of it, seasoned amongst a swamp of what looks like failed attempts at The Thing to mimic either Vsauce or Elizabeth Holmes telling telling me how I can make 300k selling ai generated art. Now- I know this might be a controversial opinion. But if you thought that artists could at any moment make that much money by just dumping slop into a market, and that there existed an avenue to turn pictures into wealth on command, in the same world mind you where people choose to go blind or have teeth removed from their body because they can't afford the proper procedures, I think aside from a revolutionary shift in your mental faculties that you should never find yourself in a voting booth or giving another human being advice ever.  

This is a throwaway account. I'm not going to check back to debate comments or retaliate. I'll lay myself on the sword and assume that I've heard every worthwhile argument while talking to actual devs working with Hugging Face, enthusiasts of it, and consuming a mass amount of media in support of it.

EDIT : I know SAI are not the only ones getting sued, but my point is that they have learnt from their mistakes and are amongst the most involved in protecting artists work. Yet people are still hating on an entire technology instead of looking at each software solution individually.

&#x200B;

# The post:

&#x200B;

Let's take some time to think about it:  Why is there a tendency to hate on an entire technology instead of the companies exploiting it the wrong way?

Sure, it's very unethical to train AI on artists' artworks if they are against it. But is it wrong to use AI in an ethical manner? MidJourney and Dall-E are both closed-source software. We don't know how it works, and it may actually be stealing art. So why are the lawsuits targetting Stable Diffusion so much?

Stable Diffusion is under a RAIL-derived license, meaning anyone can check the code, the content of any model, the training data, and they even made a website - [https://haveibeentrained.com/](https://haveibeentrained.com/) \- to remove your art from the training dataset. They're also working on an entirely free API so that future AI project can exclude opted-out art from from their own training: [haveibeentrained.com/api](https://haveibeentrained.com/api).

RAIL-derived license projects like Stable Diffusion provide an opportunity for artists and creators to train AI models on their own work, which can lead to more efficient and innovative creative processes. Rather than forbidding the use of AI technology altogether, we should encourage responsible and ethical use of this powerful tool.

Why are the lawyers targeting RAIL-derived license software when, even if StabilityAI were to lose the case, the source code would still be available to tens of thousands of developers? It is pointless to sue an RAIL-derived license project when MidJourney and Dall-E are not transparent about their algorithms, training data, and methods of obtaining it. On the other hand, StablityAI, which used copyrighted material for the training of outdated diffusion models, has learnt from their mistakes even thoygh it wasn't technically a copyright violation as of the current law, and is now putting a lot of effort in filtering those artworks from the training data for new models. Stable Diffusion 2 is excluding automatically a lot of artists, as well as NSFW content. Stable Diffusion 3 will further improve this work towards an ethical model by using the HaveIBeenTrained API.

It is concerning that some companies, like MidJourney and Dall-E, are not transparent about their algorithms, training data, and the way they obtain it. This lack of transparency undermines trust in AI technology and raises valid concerns about the way they generate images. RAIL-derived license projects like Stable Diffusion should be encouraged and supported, not sued. They are your only way to make sure your work is not straight-up sampled or stolen when generating.

It's even more concerning when you look at how OpenAI started as an open-source company, and suddenly stopped publishing anything about GPT and Dall-E.

So, why attack an entire technology, when the problem lays in the closed-source software? Why is the main target of those lawsuits StablityAI, even though it proves by its code that it doesn't sample any copyrighted images for generation, and is doing its best to remove controversial data from training?

The prospects of these serene ambitions need not be argued : the result must be obtained by time exposure. A neat catechism may be quoted from Photograms of the Year 1904. “ Is photography art ? ”
“No.” “Can it be used to express artistic feeling?” “ Yes.” “ Then let us so use it ? ”
Leaving to the future the high policy of the aristocrats, it is possible to consider the claims of the other classes. In the opinion of many of the Upper Ten, the amateur photo- grapher, whether snapshotter or tripodist, has no right to live.

What we call ""machine learning"" is actually incremental machine copying - a single digital copy operation is instead replaced with millions of rearrangement operations that when run for long enough will yield exactly the same result. ""Overfitting"" is not a ""bug"" or ""error"", it is exactly what it is being programmed to do when run for long enough time.

An interesting behavior starts to occur in a neural net when you feed it billions of different data and stop it before it has perfectly overfit to all of the data, which is that it will start fusing similar features together. In actuality, AI art is this weird frankenstein of billions of unfinished digital copy operations being run on each of the training artworks. ""Training"" is also an inaccurate word to use here, because this cannot train or learn, the only thing it's doing is copying from the training data in increments.

Or don't, continue to believe that it ""learns like a human"" because you want free art, and are really selfish that you will exploit the works of millions of artists in order to do it.

One final note: ""artificial intelligence"" is an even more misleading term because this will never be capable of being intelligent, which I will define as the ability to apply critical thinking in order to solve a problem. Neural networks cannot solve problems with critical thinking, they are just probabilistic randomness based on what appeared more often in the training data. At best, they can only display an illusion of intelligence which funnily enough has also fooled the researchers who work on them.",158,0,0.39,2023-04-30 21:21:33,,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/133z2xc/there_is_no_such_thing_as_machine_learning/,P14y3r,351

101,aiwars,1316de1,When Art Goes Kerplunk,"There's been a lot of reporting and discussions lately around artificial intelligence (AI) and it's potential dangers and downfalls, but one aspect that almost never gets brought up is how it's going to affect creativity and art. AI is going to be used to generate music, movies, books and visual art.

I was thirteen when Green Day's video for the song ""Longview"" first played on MTV, and man, it was like nothing I'd heard before. It instantly connected with me, and I went out and bought the CD a few days later. I got a guitar tablature book for the album at Guitar Center, learned every song and used to play along to them on my boombox with my black Epiphone Stratocaster. It wasn't long before I picked up Green Day's first two CDs, 1039 𝘚𝘮𝘰𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘥 𝘖𝘶𝘵 𝘚𝘭𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘺 𝘏𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘴 and 𝘒𝘦𝘳𝘱𝘭𝘶𝘯𝘬.

The singer and songwriter, Billie Joe Armstrong, was 18 and 19, respectively, when those albums were released, but some of the songs dated back even further. The music I was experiencing came directly from the heart and soul of a really talented kid who was only a few years older than I was at the time of my discovery. These early songs weren't on some next level lyrically, but they were very real and exactly what I needed at the time—right from his experiences and whatever influences he drew inspiration from. Here's an example from their song ""Dry Ice"":

𝘖𝘩 𝘐 𝘭𝘰𝘷𝘦 𝘩𝘦𝘳  
𝘒𝘦𝘦𝘱 𝘥𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘰𝘧 𝘩𝘦𝘳  
𝘞𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘐 𝘶𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘥  
𝘐𝘧 𝘴𝘩𝘦 𝘸𝘢𝘯𝘵𝘴 𝘵𝘰 𝘣𝘦 𝘮𝘺 𝘧𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘥?

𝘐'𝘭𝘭 𝘴𝘦𝘯𝘥 𝘢 𝘭𝘦𝘵𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘵𝘰 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘨𝘪𝘳𝘭  
𝘈𝘴𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘵𝘰 𝘣𝘺 𝘮𝘺 𝘰𝘸𝘯  
𝘉𝘶𝘵 𝘮𝘺 𝘱𝘦𝘯 𝘪𝘴 𝘸𝘳𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘸𝘳𝘰𝘯𝘨  
𝘚𝘰 𝘐'𝘭𝘭 𝘴𝘢𝘺 𝘪𝘵 𝘪𝘯 𝘢 𝘴𝘰𝘯𝘨

As a thirteen year old kid who liked girls but had no clue how to talk to them, this was the best. I could easily make sense of the lyrics, and they spoke even deeper because I was relating to another person—whether or not I was aware of it at the time, though I believe I was. It let me know that I wasn't alone and there were other people out there who felt he same way.

With AI, I have to question whether or not these types of songs will still widely exist and whether or not people will be as likely to form that same type of psychical connection with artists. I think with the latter, it's clear that a lot of that will be lost based on what I'm about to get into. As to whether or not these kinds of songs will still exist, what's to stop a developing songwriter from using a program to write lyrics that are well beyond their capabilities and not really real at all?

That isn't even taking into account the music itself. Of course, people will still play guitars, but when someone prompts an AI program to, let's say, write a three minute song, in the style of Green Day, about a girl, with references to Phoebe Cates, it will spit something out. The artist can then play around with that until they get what they like, but no matter how many prompts they enter in or how many times they change it, it won't truly be coming from them. The information used to create a song like this would be sourced from a giant sea of information on the internet, mashed up and interpreted based on how the programmers trained it—or how it trained itself—and then do it's best to give the artist what they were looking for.

Information on the internet isn't the same as what happens inside the human mind. Just think of your social media profiles. Are those accurate representations you? They're just surface images and only a fraction of you. They don't see inside. This is true for every piece of written language. The internet only has access to what's written down but not everything that people think and feel (no matter how much it analyzes them), and that's where art is born. Even if some kid wants to write a simple song, it will still be missing a lot of authentic characteristics.

There's also a lot of growth that goes along with being an artist, both on the creative side and as it relates to personal development, since artist's work through their ideas, often in great detail, and practice. This will stifle so much of that. The art that we create and consume has an influence on us mentally and emotionally and shapes our worldview, and just the awareness of some of the things I've mentioned is already having an effect.

Movie studios will start using AI to write scripts instead of buying the rights from authors and hiring screenwriters. The products will be set up around psychological profiles and the interests of the population, which there are endless data points on, to create something that will draw in as many people as possible.

There might be some instances where it's a useful tool and not a bad thing, but most of the time it will be a shortcut to nowhere. Yes, there will still be organic art, but a lot of the time it will be difficult, if not impossible, to discern between what's real and what isn't, and gone will be the days of naturally gifted and thoughtful artists like David Bowie, Bill Watterson and Rod Serling since they will never be able to compete.

One can only hypothesize about how this sort of thing will play out, but I imagine it won't be for the best. Since AI isn't going away any time soon, the best we can do is talk and figure out how to navigate through the next point 0 of the digital age.

Below is a response I made to some counterarguments that a friend of mine shared about the above write-up. I didn't want to include her comments in this post, but my response provides the necessary context:

I was having this conversation with a friend who's really into AI a few weeks ago, and he was making some of the same points you are. They're definitely worth mentioning, and I think there are some good ones: when someone prompts AI with an idea, that idea is at the foundation of what emerges. Where I see the problem is that the interpretation of the idea isn't coming from the artist but rather a program; a program that can't feel.

As I said in my write-up, AI can't see inside our heads. And it's not as if we're always transparent to ourselves either, but sometimes we are, and what we produce is still coming from our subjective experiences as we try to make sense of things. So, when we draw a picture or write down some words, they're a genuine product of us, even if they're influenced and inspired by external factors, which is always the case. If I can't find the right word for something, I'll go looking for it, but it's still me doing the work, not a program. AI is unable to have subjective experience, and when it interprets ideas, it's analyzing them from the point of view of something that lacks that quality. It can look at art and read what people say about it on the internet, but it can't experience art or understand it in any sort of meaningful way like a person. And the program definitely has a ""point of view.""

When it comes to synthesizers and v-drums, they're still ""analog"" in the sense that a person who uses those tools pieces things together on their own. With AI, that quality isn't present. Ninety-nine percent of it is done by a program, even if they rework it over and over again. Even if they only use AI imagery or whatever as a blueprint, that blueprint lacks life.

There will definitely be those who will prefer not to create or consume AI art. Nonetheless, I imagine it will take over just about everything in time, and I think the feeling you have about not finding it as fascinating is also something worth noting. A lot of people feel that way, and that kind of relationship to it is a cause for concern, even if it isn't articulated very often.

Don't Bluth (""The Secret of NIMH,"" ""All Dogs Go to Heaven"") worked for Disney in the 70s and became jaded with them because they were recycling old animation to cut corners. One example: there's a dance scene in ""The Jungle Book"" that they used for ""Robin Hood."" They took the basic sketches and just drew different characters over them. Now, with that knowledge, whenever I watch some of those movies, a lot of the love I had for them is lost, and it's impossible for me to go back because I can't justify it to myself. Then, when you watch the ""Secret of NIMH,"" compared to some of those other movies, it's clear how much more love went into it; how colorful it is and how much life emanates from it. It's not as if there weren't any original ideas put into those 70s movies, but a lot was still lost. AI is going to amplify that like crazy.

We're all unique and experience things in our own way. Things can strike different chords with everyone, but at the same time, there are still objective aspects to art when we're talking about artists' intentions, techniques and the thought and care that they put into their work, and their natural talents. Bob Dylan wrote some of his best songs in a matter of minutes. They just poured out of him. There's something very special about that. And I know of a lot of songs where the message is clearly misunderstood. The artists are trying to get specific points across, and some people just don't pick up on them, but they're central to the work. There will be things that look clever and deep, but they actually won't be. If AI is supposed to even the playing field, I actually look at that as a bad thing. Not everyone is Michelangelo, and they shouldn't pretend to be.

I also have to say: writing this was far more fulfilling than having a computer do it for me.",35,8,0.75,2023-04-27 23:50:50,,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/1316de1/when_art_goes_kerplunk/,somery,1701
103,aiwars,133e4qk,"Creative Destruction, Copyrights, and AI","In 1942, Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter coined the term ""creative destruction"" as ""process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one.""  The idea is that economics is a dynamic, organic process where long standing economic paradigms must occasionally be purged in order to free up resources with new innovations and technologies in order to benefit society.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creativedestruction.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creativedestruction.asp)

This is a concept that is frequently seen throughout history: World War I, for example, showed horse cavalry, a technology used for thousands of years, suddenly plunge into obsolescence to the machine gun and tank.  Nevertheless, cavalry were still seen as a vital part of warfare in the interwar period- the British and French did not begin to mechanize on a large scale until the 1930s, and the German, Polish, and Soviets used cavalry extensively in World War II for both transport and skirmishing: [https://www.strangehistory.net/2018/04/05/daily-history-picture-486/](https://www.strangehistory.net/2018/04/05/daily-history-picture-486/).

Creative destruction ultimately benefits society as a whole.  The candle industry declined after the invention of the light bulb in 1879.  Candles were difficult to light, only lasted a short while, and posed a fire hazard, all of which are issues that were either resolved or mitigated by the light bulb and light switch.  Horse-drawn carriages were replaced with the automobile, which is more efficient, faster, provides better protection for the elements, and does not require the use of animals for transportation.  Before the printing press, European literacy rates were practically non-existent outside of the clergy and despite the centrality the role of religion played in peoples' lives, the ability to read religious texts such as the Bible were oftentimes the exclusive property of a small elite.

Art has also engaged in many waves of disruption and creative destruction.  Master artists were the only way to capture a moment in time before the photograph, but there is a reason historical archives preferred even the lack of color depth of early black-and-white photographs to the stylized artwork that was available at the same time period: photography is simply more accurate at depicting what a person really looked like (as one can see looking at a list of US presidents) [https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/).  Artists have recently seen the incorporation of digital tools such as Adobe Photoshop.  The disruption art AI such as DALL-E or Stable Diffusion offers is nothing new to the art industry.

**Just because an industry is disrupted with its economic paradigms purged, that does not mean that the people who work in that industry will also die off.  Those people are left with a choice: adapt, fail, or attempt to stop the technological progress.  The candle industry survived by pivoting to a decorative ornament when it is clear that candles are no longer a practical means of light.  Horses may not carry men on battlefields or pull wagons anymore, but they are still used in the horse racing industry.  The transition will require a rethinking of existing assumptions about the industry and a realignment with a new reality, but, for the average consumer, that new reality offers more benefits than drawbacks than the old.**

Artificial intelligence technology may be wrapped up with fear over AGI developing Skynet or The Terminator, or mass displacement of jobs; but it also offers many benefits and an opportunity for us to kill outdated economic paradigms and rethink the assumptions of our existing reality.  For example, up until now, it is assumed that capital and productivity can only be produced through human labor, hence economic systems are in place where labor for 40 hours a week (often more) is coerced from the masses.  Outsourcing such jobs to capable machines can provide the first generation that does not need to ""work to live"", possibly the biggest revolution of time and freedom in human history.

AI art makes it exceptionally easy for the average individual who is unskilled to create high quality looking art.  It should be reminded that all industries are essentially oligarchies: a small, highly invested group of professionals have a specialized skill that gives them an advantage over the masses in a specific industry.  AI art does to art what the printing press does to knowledge- it makes the means of production accessible to the masses by sufficiently simplifying it.  The 1.9 million artists in the US: [https://www.lihpao.com/how-many-artists-are-there-in-the-world/](https://www.lihpao.com/how-many-artists-are-there-in-the-world/) are a tiny minority compared to the millions, if not billions will have the ability to create art at their fingertips with minimal skill needed.  Much like how the small minority of clergy in the Middle Ages are a tiny minority compared to the millions of Europeans who benefited from Johannes Gutenberg's printing press.

And then we go to ethics.  How ethical is it that art should be allowed to be used to train these giant algorithms (many of which such as Stable Diffusion are open source) without the consent of the creator?   I would argue that copyright law in its current state (and the attitudes of such) is not ethical and gives far too much power to an oligarchy of artists at the expense of billions of internet users.  Economics is the science built on scarcity and managing unlimited needs with limited resources.  But, what if resources became unlimited?  The internet may be the first true post-scarcity economic setting, as although the *amount* of data can be finite, the *amount* of data that can exist in the current form is not.  For example: you require aluminum, steel, and rubber to make a car, all of which exist in finite amounts in the Earth,  but a digital JPEG can be recreated ad infinitum through copy and paste.  **The very foundation of copyright law is built on scarcity of form, which no longer exists for any digital media as of 1991.**

Instead of trying to adapt to a new post-scarcity setting, artists rallied against ""copyright infringement"" and tried to shut down uncontrolled ""copying"" of images en masse, in order to protect their existing businesses.  Napster was shut down, ""piracy"" was outlawed, and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and similar provisions were passed to bring artificial scarcity to a digital world, through shaming, propaganda- ""don't copy that floppy"", DRMs, and legal threats.  Although none of which have been truly effective at curbing piracy, it gave artists the illusion that they could continue on selling commissions as if scarcity of form still exists in the internet age.

And here we are today, where an oligarchy of artists clinging onto a legacy paradigm that simply does not exist anymore insists that technology cater to them rather than adapt to a new system, at the expense of everyone else.  In our current world, you can't freely share games with your friends.  Fanart, remixes, and fangames are in a legal grey zone always under the threat of copyright strikes.  Copyright law lasts 70-110 years after an artist's death: there is no hope anyone here will be alive to see the first legal derivative work of Super Mario Bros or The Legend of Zelda.  Due to the Internet's post-scarcity nature, there is nothing physically preventing people from doing all of this, en masse, besides the legal threat in order to institute artificial scarcity.  Instead of promoting creative destruction, the internet was simply bent to shape around an outdated paradigm in order to shelter one more generation of artists from the reality of technological change.  We banned the light bulb in order to protect the candle industry.

With the debate of how copyrights affect AI art, we are given another opportunity for creative destruction of an unethical art oligarchy hell-bent to turn the clock back to 1990 in order to protect the interest of a minority of artists.  New economic paradigms for profit that do not rely on selling a scarce commodity, such as donations or advertisements, have been developed in the 21st century.  Today's artists are being provided increasingly more options off the copyright train, in an age where the allure of large machine learning models using millions of user data to solve highly advanced problems like art generation is increasingly enticing companies.  Critically, the US Copyright Office has refused copyright for AI generated works, allowing for a large avenue away from the authoritarian scarcity of copyright into a world where data can be free in the public domain: [https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/21/22944335/us-copyright-office-reject-ai-generated-art-recent-entrance-to-paradise](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/21/22944335/us-copyright-office-reject-ai-generated-art-recent-entrance-to-paradise).

This decade could be a very disruptive decade for everyone, particularly ones in the art industry.  It could be the opportunity to use AI to finally rid the internet of the shackles of over 30 years of copyright authoritarianism.  AI generative models, trained on millions of anonymous data and using it- not to copy it- but to learn to generate original content purely from white noise, that is free from copyright, could open up millions of people to be able to easily express themselves without the fear of DMCA looming over their shoulders in a minefield of copyright.  Creative destruction in the art industry will inevitably cause short term pain, but new markets and types of artists will arise, greater in number, able to deliver better art.  Or perhaps the voices in the art community and art lobby will prevail over the voices of the masses, convincing legislators to maintain the status quo and shelter yet another generation of artists from technological change.  The end goal of industrialization has always been to reach a utopia, free of scarcity where anyone can be whoever they want and do anything they want.  The Internet provides a glimpse into that utopia, and how institutions built around the assumptions of scarcity such as copyrights and trademarks have interacted with a post-scarcity scenario over the last 30 years are highly concerning and do not bode well for our future.",31,15,0.81,2023-04-30 05:58:01,,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/133e4qk/creative_destruction_copyrights_and_ai/,GrovyleXShinyCelebi,1648
104,aiwars,136fewq,"I love AI, but Text-to-Image simply isn't the way to go for AI art","Ever since AI image generation technology has started becoming scarily good, I have been captivated by the potential this technology held for artists. It could allow them to take their imagination and style in directions that would previously be considered impossible, and my mind has recently been racing with ideas on how this tech could be applied properly for this....  

Unfortunately, this community doesn't seem to be looking in this direction. Instead, we're here only focusing on how to create pictures from just a few words and eliminating most of the processes behind art creation that gives the art actual value. I feel this is absolutely not the path we should be following if we want to ensure a bright future for art. This, I feel, is a waste of the potential that the tech holds for art.   

First of all, I partially agree with the luddites that the current default work flow for AI art (typing words into a box and hoping for the best) doesn't really make you anywhere near as good of an artist as those of literally any other medium of art that has existed since the beginning of humanity. It's more akin to commissioning a different artist (the AI) to create the image for you after giving them only a paragraph of text to follow. Except in this case, the artist (the AI) doesn't really understand what it's doing. It doesn't have any actual imagination or emotion of its own. It's just imitating what has already been done in the past, and as a result, its output usually comes with varying levels of wonkiness or bizzare imperfections that would be simply inexcusable with real human-made art.  

And that's where my issue is: AI image generation technology has immense potential for artists, AS A TOOL. The difference between past pieces of art technology and this one is that the past ones actually empowered artists, eliminating only the manual uncreative aspects and physical restrictions, and simultaneously multiplying the scope of what they can do, WHILE STILL LETTING THEM PUT EVERY FIBER OF THEIR BEING INTO THE ART. but the way we're raising the Text-to-Image AI tech isn't following that path. It's seeking to leave the actual creation entirely to the machine and eliminating human involvement as much as possible. *THAT IS NOT WHAT WE AI ARTISTS SHOULD BE AIMING FOR! NOT AT ALL!!* don't you people realize that not only is this absolutely not what art is about, but that this could also spell doom for the future of art in the future? If eventually you all get your wish and AI Text-to-Image or Text-to-video works were to dominate the art space and end up displacing human made works, then eventually the AIs would eventually start training off their own past generations (not a good outcome at all), most of the fundamental knowledge we currently have of art would fade away after being deemed ""unnecessary"", and just like that, boom. RIP art and creation as we know it. If this is the future you're all okay with, then I think I'd rather side with the civil non-toxic AI opposers who at least understand the value of art.   

So instead of looking for new ways to displace the actual process of creating art and eliminating user input, we ought to be focusing on how we can develop this tech so as to empower artists. So as to let them put in more of themselves into the resulting works. For instance, rather than creating images from text alone, focus on how you can make the AI build very strictly off the content made by the human user. That way, even if the AI doesn't fully understand what it's doing or how to create structures from scratch, it won't really matter as long as the human user does. The quality of the elements in the image would then be proportional to the artistic skill of the artist, and text prompts could then serve as a way to give the AI some more context on how it's supposed to go about rendering each hand-drawn element. This is just part of the idea that's been in my mind for some time. I'll later make a separate post illustrating this much more clearly.  

Tools like Controlnet are already a step in the right direction. But IMO, it still has a long way to go before it's satisfactory enough for artists, and even its users at some points still aren't using it the right way.   

Anyways, if the AI art community could only buckle down on actually empowering artists instead of replacing them, then I'm sure even the anti-AI luddites would be excited for it.

They can't accept their irrational fear if... well irrational and overboard.

What do I mean? Well the main complaint against AI art is ist ai trains/steals other peoples art. But when you point out it steals nothing but instead learns. They then move to ""AI art isn't art!"", when you debunk that with a simple reality check on what art is, they move on to ""Ai art is just cheaply made crap that looks like everything else!"". When you debunk that also and show most artists make crap that looks like everything else, they move onto...  


""AI art will take our jobs!"". When you debunk that and show them its hardly the case, then they move on to ""AI art can be sold despite being someones else idea!"", after you debunk that with their furry art/ anime...etc is all the same and looks like other stuff people sell, they move onto very random things like ""AI art is for lazy people!"" or super nit picky garbage.  


I mean, do really think people are going to take you seriously when you move the goal posts around constantly in hopes of ""HA! SEE! You can't defend what I just said!""

I see a rising trend of asking AI content to be flagged. However efforts seem to be going the other way: validating human made content without the use of AI. 


As usual the devil is in the details. And the floating question of what should be the default. 


Historically it's cheaper and easier to certify content than to find every instance of fake content and flag it. 
Real life examples: Hologram stickers on geniune merch. Twitter blue checkmark. Windows author software signature. Trademarks registry. And many more. 

There are fewer cases, and none that I recall, where searching for every piece of counterfeit anything was successful. This should give us an idea of just how this is likely to go. 


A recent trend of artists and companies trying to flag anything AI generated will likely enact humans to put the effort to modify it enough that it's no longer flagged. Bringing the exact oposite of what they want because the default status of every piece online would be considered human made.

I mean they always say the art tends to not be that great, tends to have issues, doesn't have emotion/feeling to it....etc. Well if AI art is as bad as you say? Why would you get mad about it? It's like a giant company like Coke being mad at some small company who sells their own version of pop in some tiny city in the US. It just wouldn't make sense.   


I think most are mad because the art is actually GOOD and they hate it makes them feel kinda worthless since AI can outdo them in most ways. I mean if this is the case, at least admit that's the reason. And while I can sympathize with feeling inferior to a AI, it certainly seems unproductive to call people names who enjoy making art with AI. Just like I'm sure there are artists who draw by hand, who hate artists who use digital tools like Photoshop to make things. We all use the tools that work for us.   


This is why the art community can never fully get along. There is always classicism at play. ""I drew this through Photoshop!"", ""Psh, I drew mine by hand!"". Again I understand how AI makes people feel but I have to wonder if people ever thought about the future. Did you ever not think technology would come to a point where art might become way to easy to make? Heck robots and AI will replace sooo many things as time goes on.

114,aiwars,12rtk8g,The difference between an AI tool and a camera and graphic design tools?,"In these debates, I always see that AI is not a tool, it's the actual artist. Wouldn't that also apply for a digital camera then? Let me explain:

*In both, the operator inputs parameters, presses a button, and gets back a result. The camera, like the AI tool, is doing most of the “work” to generate the image the operator wants based on their initial inputs.*

*Instead of toggling buttons, and setting a scene physically, in AI  text-to-image, ""words"" are the toggles and directions to set the scene.*

This is even more true now as camera technology implements a lot of AI in order to capture the best results in a variety of conditions with minimal human effort.

But framing still matters. Composition still matters. Knowing which settings to use to capture the best results still matters.

Give the same camera to a photographer and some random joe and ask them to go take a photo of the sunset, and you will quickly see the difference in their ""artistry"" given the same exact tool, subject and constraints.

Sure, there is an additional element in AI generations because the output can be more affected by the AI than a camera would influence a photograph, but the machine is doing the actual work to achieve the desired effects.

I really view AI much like a camera. While a camera captures snapshots of visuals you encounter in real life, an AI is like a camera for your mind, capturing and rendering visuals in your imagination.

Ultimately, I think this is indeed the direction technology will eventually go: the ability to ""think"" and render something for others to see. The creative work would literally all take place within your mind.

Perhaps I've been more willing to embrace this technology because I've always viewed art **more about recombination than replication**. AI is an incredibly powerful recombination tool, allowing me to combine disparate elements and styles nearly instantly to bring a vision to life.

When I use these tools, I don't view myself as an artist, more like an explorer/director/curator/designer.

I've embraced AI I think in part because my background is more in graphic design and photography. I view it as more of an extension of tools I've used before like Photoshop and Illustrator.

I can see why there is more of a blowback from illustrators though, since their creative process is often much different.

I used to do photoshop battles 20 years ago, and the process then was more laborious. If I wanted to render an image of George W. Bush riding a Dragon over a war-torn Iraq, this would be my process:

1. Scour the internet for photos of the individual elements I'd need for the composition
2. Painstakingly remove the background from each element I want to use in the composition
3. Arrange the elements in the composition to tell the story I want to tell visually
4. Work on matching colors, lighting and shadows between elements so that they look as cohesive as possible

Today, the process even within just Photoshop itself is much easier to accomplish, thanks to AI. You can instantly remove a background. Instantly add filters so that every element looks like a cohesive whole.

And in the process I described, I was still reliant on photos other people took, and much more constrained in what was available to use, often reliant on stock photos and such.

But do people trash people who use Photoshop today because it's so much easier than it was 20 years ago? I don't see it.

So I wish the anti-AI crowd would take a moment to step back and see how this is indeed simply a tool. Like any other tool, it can be used for good or for bad. It can be used lazily or to stretch the boundaries of artistic expression.

117,aiwars,12ygwnx,Would it be a good idea to create an open source model trained entirely on opt-in data?,"Long Post. Please bear with me... 

   Probably the biggest controversy surrounding AI image generators is the fact that they're trained on other people's work, without their consent. It has reached the point that AI users are being demonized over it, being called thrives and whatnot.

And Adobe recently made their own image generator made entirely on licensed images, but people were still up in arms against them, accusing them of using ""sleazy tactics"" to con and Rob the image creators. This kinda shows that the whole copyright controversy is partially just an excuse for artists to call for AI to die. And they'll continue to cling to this until AI ceases to exist.

Anyways, I've gotten an idea that the AI community could begin preparing training a new AI model from scratch. But rather than randomly scraping the data from the internet or from any random database for training , they'll only train with images that were willingly uploaded by the owners/creators who are in support of the technology, want to contribute to make it better, and don't mind the images they upload being used to generate more images. In other words, the data used to train the models will not only be legally ethical, but also perfectly morally so. Since every image used would have the full approval of the creators.

I personally think this could finally kill off the argument that AI images are ""tHeFt"", and shut down any opportunity for the opposes to move the goalposts on what they conceive as ""concept"" in this matter. Maybe this could force them to actually be honest with their true motivations for wanting AI to die, and we could finally have an actual civilized discussion on the REAL potential issues AI could have.

Unfortunately, the resulting model would be inferior to the existing ones we have today. But AI users could use it without having to feel guilty about leeching off other's work. 

Also, this procedure of providing training data could lead to the rise of some new communities dedicated to ethically procuring training images for different styles, scenarios or objects. Like, imagine an online community dedicated to collecting images of HANDS for training the model. Or a community of photographers who spend a fraction of their time taking photos of different subjects for training. Or even just random phone users taking photos of stuff around them and uploading them to the training database. This could generate a large amount of training data and open the anti-AI's eyes to how much support there is for AI.

Anyways that's just my idea on what we could do to ensure an environment where AI doesn't have to be frowned upon. Is it naive? Or could it actually work?",17,7,0.71,2023-04-25 14:44:03,,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/12ygwnx/would_it_be_a_good_idea_to_create_an_open_source/,Soibi0gn,454

120,aiwars,12n92lj,AI creating a boom in Naive or Folk Art; the social power for change that AI can bring,"Traditionally there have been two broad categories of ""serious"" artists working in ""fine art"" (that is, art for art's sake, not commercial art or art with some other purpose than to just be art):

* Classically trained artists, and
* Naive or Folk artists

I think we all know what a classically trained artist is.

Naive or folk artists (I'll just say folk artist from here on, but for a break-down of the field, see [this page](https://uscupstate.libguides.com/c.php?g=258004&p=1722519)) are those who have not had some or all of the training one would expect of an artist who contributes to the literal state of the art (as opposed to a hobbiest whose work is not widely influential).

My favorite example of a folk artist is [Ralph Fasanella](https://folkartmuseum.org/exhibitions/ralph-fasanella-lest-we-forget/), a personal friend of my family when I was growing up, who I always knew as a labor activist, cigar smoker and lover of rich, hand-made Italian foods. His art was powerful, not because of technique or training, but because it conveyed a powerful and personal experience with blue-collar communities struggling under the weight of economic disfavor.

Today's Ralph Fasanella's, I'm sure, will find their way to AI art. This is not because they're ""lazy"" or ""greedy"" but because they have important ideas to express to the world. Artists who come from poor or working-class communities cannot always afford to just quit their day jobs and go to art school. But that doesn't mean that they don't have powerful messages to convey. AI provides them with a way to do that.

I think Raph would have blown our minds with what he could have created with AI, and would have spent days working with tools like Stable Diffusion to bring what he had experienced to life. Inpainting would be a particular favorite of his, as he loved to put the minutiae of daily life into every square inch of his enormous canvases.

But I'm not just looking back. Imagine what a kid in Brooklyn today will create in a year or a decade with this tech? He'll be busy working 2 jobs, but will spend his off-hours bringing his experiences to life in a way that no other folk artist in history prior to AI has been able to do! He'll share with the world things that we either don't have the context for or perhaps don't want to know because we like to look away from the downtrodden.

We're not democratizing art. We're blowing up the boundaries that require that kind of thinking! We can all communicate in a rich language that only a few had mastered before, and while, yes, many of us will rush in to find out what the cuss-words are in this language, or how to market commercial products in it, there will also be a swell of sophisticated and otherwise marginalized voices speaking in a tongue that they had previously not been privileged to learn. I see this is a great step in the moral arc of humanity.",10,14,0.8,2023-04-15 19:04:55,,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/12n92lj/ai_creating_a_boom_in_naive_or_folk_art_the/,Tyler_Zoro,490

125,aiwars,12vvwom,StableDiffusion is MOSTLY not a collage tool: how much of a given piece is AI art actually memorizing/referencinb/learning/stealing?,"First, let me clarify, I am not claiming that there is no overfitting going on, or that data duplication is negligible.

What I am claiming is that the average unique image in LAION-5B is not being memorized to any substantial extent by StableDiffusion or any similarly-sized model, but some highly duplicated images definitely have minor memorization going on.



Reasoning:

*

1. LAION-5B is almost incomprehensibly big. 5.85 Billion image-text pairs. If you were to scroll through it at 2 images a second, it would take you a century. If we assume that the images are each 1 MB in size, that is a 5850 TB training set.

*

2. StableDiffusion is 4.3 GB in size. Ergo, it has effectively done some extremely convoluted translation of 5,850,000 GB of images into a 4.3 GB neural network. Thus, roughly 6 bits of an ""average"" image in the set has been copied.

*

3. But not every image is average! English-labelled training data is about 40% of LAION-5B, and about 45% of the English-labelled images are in fact duplicates or near-duplicates. As an upper bound, we could assume that everything not labelled in English or not labelled in an identifiable language at all is duplicated, effectively implying that 78% of the dataset would be duplicates. This isn't accurate. As a lower bound, we could assume that data labelled in languages besides English or no identifiable language at all contains no duplicates, implying that 18% of the dataset is duplicates. I'm going to conveniently ignore this and assume the duplication rate is 45% across the board, but you could run the numbers for other assumptions. That means that there would be about about 3.2 Billion unique images if LAION-5B were fully deduplicated.

*

4. Training images are equally important. But some images are more equal than others. Particularly, duplicates each count as a separate training sample even if their content is near identical. If an AI is trained on 10 copies of the same image, it will effectively give this highly duplicated image 10 times the importance. However, this doesn't necessarily mean it will devote 10x the information theoretic resources to those images in particular. It could devote the same amount and focus on getting the unique images correct, or it could devote as much as 10x. There will be a diminishing returns though, so the real value is almost certainly somewhere in between. The conclusion is that unique images will be weighted beyond their representation in the training set, but the collective weight of highly duplicated images outweighs that of one off unique ones. The most egalitarian scenario is that for every unique image, StableDiffusion has memorized about 11 bits of information on it. This scenario is however likely incorrect. The least egalitarian scenario is that there are no diminishing returns and representation in StableDiffusion is exactly proportional to duplicate representation in the training set. Meaning that the mean unique image is represented in StableDiffusion by 11 bits, but some highly duplicated images will be represented much better. Notably, it takes about 32 bits to reference a single unique sample out of 3.2 billion, and 24 bits to represent a single pixel uncompressed.

*

5. We can think of duplicated images a bit like the distribution of wealth or income (more like income) in a private sector economy.  The vast majority of the duplication probably goes to a small fraction of the training set. We know with certainty tha the top ~80% most duplicated images have 100% of the duplicates, but in reality duplication is probably much more harshly distributed. The GINI is impossible to know exactly, but we do know that 55% of the representation is egalitarian in the English language data. If we extrapolate and say that this is true at every possible lower cutoff point. I.E. That 55% of the top 1% is also egalitarian within that 1%, then we can guess that for example the top 50% has all or all of that inequality, and thus at most 72.5% of the total training set. We can then say that 55% of 72.5%, or 39.875%, of the total set is in the egalitarian component of that 55. So basically, the Median unique image would be duplicated 1.45 times in the training set. However there is a problem. We just said that there was no representative inequality in the bottom 50% of unique images. We have just proven this to be untrue by contradiction. The actual amount of representation in the training set of the bottom 50% of unique images must actually be somewhere between 27.5% and 39.875%. However, because of the other assumptions we made about the distribution, we can safely assume it is less than 33.6875%. This means though that only 66.3125% of the training would be represented in the top 1%, reducing our estimate for the median. If we applied this recursively and we can guesstimate that maybe ~68-70% of the training data is in the top 50% of unique images and 30-32% in the bottom 50%, and the real median is more like 1.36-1.40. This means for example that the 99th percentile most duplicated unique image is represented 8 or 9 times in the traing set. And the 99.9999999th percentile (the top third or fourth unique image) might be 10000-20000 times represented in the training set.

*

Thus, the top few unique images represent somewhere between 11 and 120000 bits of information. 15 kB is not enough to losslessly compress anything the size of a stable diffusion output, so lossless copying definitely shouldn't occur, but it is enough that the top few images in the training set will be reproduced with amazing accuracy. That being said, we should note that even distinguishing two unique images from one another requires 32 bits of stored information. Thus, only around 2-3% of unique images are duplicated enough that overfitting might be a valid strategy. It is worth noting though that this means around 14% of the training set could POTENTIALLY be overfitted on, thus implying overfitting between 0-14% of outputs at least a little bit. Note overfitting is not collaging. But it is learning to copy specific style cues from individual images instead of averages.

*

However, 0-14% overfitting is a pretty wide range for ""how much does SD draw from memorization of small details in specific images vs averaging?"" That's the difference between 86% original AI artwork in the general styles of human artists but 14% ripping something from somewhere, and 100% original artwork but never actually ripping off anyone. Studies I have seen suggest a real value of 1.9% of the output of StableDiffusion are the result of overfitting, which is interesting because we can use that as a way to estimate how sensitive SD is to duplication in the training set. Right, the fact that this implies the 99.93rd percentile is the threshold of overfitting rather than the 97.5th percentile as the worst case scenario assumes, means that we can estimate that the allometry of duplication in the training set to memorization in SD is approximately 0.5. That is, if there is 100 of something in the training set, SD's training process devotes about 10 times more resources to it. This heavily suggests that SD is probably spending around 100 B on the most overrepresented images but more like 1 B on an average unique image. Admittedly these numbers should be taken with a grain of salt and could be off by quite a bit. 100 B is enough to store about 50 tokens of information on an image, but 1 B won't even store a single token. 50 tokens is a decent length prompt, so the top few images in the training set basically have 1 whole prompt memorized about them. With about as many degrees of freedom as keeping the prompt constant and switching the seed around, which is admittedly quite specific, but also a lot left to interpretation. The vast majority of the unique images and of the training set overall has nothing in particular memorized about it individually. SD doesn't remember that most images are even district from each other.


*


So in short, most of SD's training set and output is not based on memorization at the level of individual images and could not be based on memorization at the level of individual images. Very overrepresent images probably get about 1 decent prompt worth of specification allocated to them, which is more than enough to copy a style or specific details, but not enough to copy the work as a whole, and the result of this memorization should vary by about the same amount that changing the seed does. It is hard to argue that 1 prompt worth of information about an image is enough to qualify as copyright infringement for the same reason that it is hard to argue that 1 prompt worth of information is copyrightable, so very likely even heavily duplicated images are not subject to any more copyright infringement than writing a prompt about that image and putting it through an AI image generator that didn't include it in the training set.

*

This also implies quite strongly that the AI is much more sensitive to whether the prompt contains the elements of the image than how much the image is represented in the training set. I.E. You could copy a specific image as (in) effectively as SD has memorized it just by writing a prompt about it, even if SD has never seen that image before. Is that infringement? I don't know. I'm inclined to think not.

*

However, it is worth noting that whether or not it infringes copyright has little to do with whether or not SD is in fact a competitive threat to artists in the form of automation. The intellectual property criticism may be misguided. You can't copyright a vague style and SD information theoretically can't generally copy an image or any substantial part beyond a vague theme. But a competitive threat posed by automation, made stronger by every non-AI image that can be harvested to feed it, regardless of copyright, is still very real even if IP is largely irrelevant and images are not being substantially memorized or copied.

*

In short, AI art is probably a threat to artists because it is automated competition, but it probably isn't memorizing enough detail to redraw your individual images. Not even if you're famous.",11,8,0.72,2023-04-23 07:42:54,,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/12vvwom/stablediffusion_is_mostly_not_a_collage_tool_how/,pds314,1717

130,aiwars,12jxauz,Why I love and hate AI art.,"So today someone was asking me about one of my backgrounds in a piece and they recoiled when I told them that the background isn't my creation entirely. That it's mostly AI. What I do is I sketch up a background, usually wide sweeping fields into mountains with rivers, but I don't get into the serious detail because once I have a good base I send it through an AI with it set to put trees and the detail that's not the main focus of the piece. Now, I DO go through the tedious task of tracing everything over. It doesn't take forever, but it does take longer than I'd like to admit. After the background is done? I use the creation part of my mind. I'll add in an array of things. Castles, Planes, skies, planets, medieval sieges/battles, or do some where's Waldo stuff. 

THAT is why I love AI Art. It can take the tedious part of creating menial and unimportant details while following a baseline I give it. Yet, what makes me hate it? 

This IS going to irk some folk but I can't stand the work that just gets born out of some words. There are a lot (NOT ALL) but a lot of people who type in some keywords/phrases, get a lot, choose a couple, send them through, and repeat until something comes up they like and posting that.

Based on my previous post and out of curiosity, is there a big company that can represent artists and their concerns? Since, Disney is laying in a trap for concern people and Antis and is therefore ill equip.

I saw a few comments from artists in the vid that I posted, saying ""They felt abandoned and being told to shut up."" and one made a tirade stating that ""Disney doesn't do: spam, art thievery, puts people out of jobs, etc."" (Little does he know). Despite that the vid was made by a ""little guy""/indie dev.

137,ArtistLounge,13c1qk6,AI art has ruined Art Station,"I used to love this site. I've logged in almost daily since I took upon myself becoming an artist, specifically concept artist or illustrator. It used to be an amazing site, where you could see the pros and aspiring artist grow, and get tons of inspiration and ideas. That is all gone now.

Now I enter the site, and the first thing i see is a big square with a clearly AI generated generic pretty anime/stylized girl, which suspiciously looks like the style of an already stablished artist, but strangely enough, its not the artist himself who posted this? 

Next thing you realize, people are selling AI generated reference and other stuff, which i find mind boggling, but even more so that there are people that buy it. And even more mind/boggling so that a site as big as Art Station allows this.

Best of all, they claim to have taken ""measures"" against ai art to ""protect"" artists. What a bombastic, huge, humoungous amount of crap. i don't know what exactly happened, but there is probably some suitcase passing behind the scenes. This ""measure"" is putting a check box in the filters, which you will have to look hard for it, because it's at the bottommost of the list. Only the decision to put it there says a lot. People made this page, nothing is placed somewhere out of randomness or laziness.

And this doesnt even filter out a lot of the ai generated content, because the artist himself has to state the fact that he used it in the program list. Which AI artist in their sane mind would put it there?? It's like automatically blacklisting yourself. This measure is beyond useless.

The part that makes me sad the most, is that now i just don't go to this site anymore. It's practically impossible to tell what is AI generated and what is not. And there are cases of normal artists getting flak for supposedly using it, and viceversa.

ArtStation is the portfolio site. It's ment to gauge the skill of the artists, not blow up like instagram or tiktok. It's ment for pros looking for fresh hires and upcoming artists.

In the 1960s and 70s, the widespread use of photography and film led to the rise of conceptual art, which emphasized ideas and concepts over physical objects. Conceptual artists often used photography and film as part of their work but used them in new and unconventional ways that challenged traditional art forms.

With artists worried about their livelihood, it has also raised questions about the works used as training data.

Do you believe a new art movement will arise to challenge these norms?

Instagram’s algorithm is decidedly anti-artist, so is twitter’s (aside from Elon Musk’s strange behavior ruining the app experience), Tumblr just isn’t popular anymore, and Tiktok demands too much content output & their algorithm makes no sense. 

Tiktok was a good option for a while, and is great to find *other* artists and build community that way, but I find it’s also very anti-artist at the end of the day for being able to show off your work. You’ll make one post that goes viral that you spent no effort on, then the painting you want others to see gets 20 likes or something. 

Tumblr was my favorite back in the day. It just doesn’t have a high number of users these days.

I understand that people don't like the autonomous process and the fact that they steal images to blend into AI art (which is understandable cause thats not good), however I don't know if these things are true just cause I'm reading them online.

All of this stuff is really going over my head, I wasn't really involved in the online art community for a while and I came back to this whole new ordeal right after the end of the NFT craze (which i still never fully understood)

Personally, I'm not intimidated by AI art because I feel like it is a new technological trend that will die out when people get bored of it.

I know human art skills will NEVR be obsolete for 2 reasons.

1: A robot smooshing pictures together surely can't be a long term solution to replace artists lol

2: People are always hesitant to rely on automatic services and sometimes prefer ""hand-made"" stuff

I've heard lots of arguments in FAVOR of AI art as well, it's a more accessible means of expression and seems like a tool no different than using a complex tool in photoshop (that's a stretch but I'm really just repeating what I see)

I have no interest in AI art other than thinking it's kind of neat a computer could generate something that looks so human, but i also understand why its equally terrifying.

Overall, I'm completely neutral, kind of confused, and just wanting to figure out why everyone is FREAKING OUT over AI art. Should I be worried, should I hate it?

I'm hoping that people of both ends of the argument can give me good points and reasoning for their side and that this won't become a flame war. Please try to be civil lmao

Again sorry for my ignorance

It is more about how the discussions we are having today about what is and isn't art have always existed. **""It looks like Art but is not art.""**

There are a lot of people now trying to draw a line in the sand between AI and art. Drawing hard lines in the sand this way to AI users has actually been applied to artists throughout history and unfortunately still today. Its a similar thing art elitists have said about art and artists working in popular culture such as comics, video games, illustration, design or anything not contemporary art. Its not a good attitude imo and would exclude a lot of people in those industries today being called artists if everyone had that view of what art is.

This was wrote by a serious art critic in **1939** in a famous essay. Its called Avant Garde and Kitsch by Clement Greenberg.

*Kitsch: popular, commercial art and literature with their chromeotypes, magazine covers, illustrations, ads, slick and pulp fiction, comics, Tin Pan Alley music, tap dancing, Hollywood movies, etc*

*Kitsch, using for raw material the debased and academicized simulacra of genuine culture, welcomes and cultivates this insensibility. It is the source of its profits. Kitsch is mechanical and operates by formulas. Kitsch is vicarious experience and faked sensations. Kitsch changes according to style, but remains always the same. Kitsch is the epitome of all that is spurious in the life of our times. Kitsch pretends to demand nothing of its customers except their money-not even their time.*

*If the avant-garde imitates the processes of art, kitsch, we now see, imitates its effects. The neatness of this antithesis is more than contrived; it corresponds to and defines the tremendous interval that separates from each other two such simultaneous cultural phenomena as the avant-garde and kitsch*.

An easier example

*Kitsch refers to popular and commercial art, like magazine covers, illustrations, advertisements, pulp fiction, comics, and Hollywood movies, that imitate and profit from debased and simplified versions of genuine culture.* ***Kitsch is mechanical, formulaic, and appeals to insensibility. It changes with style, but remains the same at its core. Kitsch is fake and demands only money from its customers, not their time or genuine engagement. The avant-garde imitates the processes of art, while kitsch imitates the effects of art.*** *This stark contrast defines the significant gap between these two cultural phenomena.*

This all sounds eerily similar to what we are now saying about AI art today and its from nearly a century ago. If there's a point to any of this, its that the arguments we are having today are not truly unique to our time.",6,2,0.58,2023-04-22 09:44:53,Art History,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/12uxhnc/ai_it_looks_like_art_but_its_not_art_a_comparison/,Imaginary_Ad_2478,446

163,ArtistLounge,12xeeg7,Being an artist online seems pointless now,"Part of what I love about being an artist is sharing my art and talking with other artists and people passionate about art. I’ve been using Twitter and Instagram for many years and I loved it.
But now it just makes me feel miserable. It’s a constant grind just so maybe my followers keep seeing me in their feeds. It's starting to feel like a chore. I spend more time fighting the algorithm than drawing.

I’m even starting to compare myself to others artists like it's some kind of competition even though I’ve never been like that before. Seeing tweets with 500+ likes when I struggle to get 20 is ruining my self-esteem as an artist.

And I keep seeing other artists talking about the same issues, which makes it even more depressing. And with AI… it just feels pointless.
Art is how I connect with others and make people happy but it’s getting too difficult to do.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the suggestions, reality check and kind words.

164,ArtistLounge,12r0fye,Friends Started Using AI,"I'm curious if anyone else is experiencing this. Do you have friends who you don't just not like what they're making, but you don't respect that they're making it? Doesn't have to be AI related.

I have a couple of friends and family who have started to generate images with AI a lot.

One of these friends is calling it their art and they've started to promote it. They think the reason artists don't like AI is because we're afraid of it. They also think there's nothing unethical about it and AI is a new medium.

Another friend has started using it in stuff they sell on Etsy. They think artists just need to accept it.

I've talked to them about my reservations about AI, but they disagree. Both of them consider themselves to be artists. I think they don't want to put in effort to learn skills and make things themselves.

I don't want to ruin friendships over this or be a discouraging friend, but it's started to make me respect them less overall. What they're doing feels fake to me. Starting to feel like I don't even want to talk to them.

Edit: Wow thanks for all the great discussions, it was really thought-provoking, validating, and challenging all at once. I need a break now but just wanted to say that.",322,172,0.94,2023-04-18 22:03:29,Community/Relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/12r0fye/friends_started_using_ai/,Sharetimes,217
165,ArtistLounge,13dcora,The AI situation and how it is affecting people,"It's so sad to see how things are going.

Every segment of social media (like some subs in Reddit) focused on art I check these days has a large portion of it filled with people, especially beginners, deeply afraid of how AI is affecting the artistic world... And I totally understand. Even outside of the internet, my irl friends who rely on art for their income and/or mental health are concerned, talking about it often and most lost motivation to some extent.

I did not stop making my own art, but I seldom feel a lack of motivation remembering that my skill might be rendered pointless for consumers and companies in comparison to optimized machines.

I always saw artists as people with a deep need for expression and creativity. To see this kind of professionals lose their faith in their own career is so depressing and disheartening.

I hope we get better regulation soon.",42,50,0.8,2023-05-10 04:37:14,Mental Health,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/13dcora/the_ai_situation_and_how_it_is_affecting_people/,Aaronjohnes,150

I’m not sure what I want to do with my life but art is important to me. I don’t know… it feels like I’m being silly drawing original characters and having them look average when I see someone 10 years younger drawing like they are professionals. It also hard to balance life and art. I work non-art jobs for income and I try to sit and draw but things get in the way. Also with the AI getting really good at making art it just discourage me more? 

I think this is more me venting how I feel about being 30 and drawing the way I do. How it’s hard for me to find time to make my art into a business?

Now that AI has taken over, I don't know where to go to find that sense of community DA once gave me. All other platforms are either not tailored for artists (Instagram and Twitter), full of AI imagery (ArtStation), or so small/new there is hardly any traffic on there and have frequent bugs (Artfol, Inkblot). The only seemingly popular one is Pixiv but it's all in Japanese and mostly exclusive to anime artists. I just miss the bustling chaotic community DA once was. Ten years ago, I used to spend every afternoon and evening after school posting and browsing art on DA. It was my major source of inspiration, tutorials, and stock materials. Even as a totally inexperienced artist who just started learning digital art, I got some watchers and people commenting/requesting my drawings. It was fun and I felt part of a community.

168,ArtistLounge,13327qq,Mihoyo and ai,"Warning long post 

Tldr; biggest company in the Gacha game industry testing the waters of ai art (! Not in the game itself!) , very few people seems to know or care, I’m afraid of what this means for other parts of this heavily art dependent field. This also might leach into other parts of the gaming world and might be the start of something bigger. Or, I hope, it dies down. 

For those that don’t know, Mihoyo is one of the biggest gacha game company with titles such as Genshin Impact and Honkai Impact 3rd. It’s a billion dollar company and a leader in the industry.

Now, the issue lies in their newest launch of Honkai: Star Rail.

Just 3 days after launch, they have a new cn exclusive web event, which basically uses a Lora model to generate ai art of one of their mascot characters. They’re encouraging players to put in pictures and the ai converts it to the character in what’s clearly a mainstream ai art style. They claim that “all images of March 7th (mascot in question) are owned by mihoyo”, but it’s clear from their phrasing (and the certainly not mihoyo art style) that all other data which doesn’t pertain to this specific character are not owned by them. That means that the basis of the ai is the same stolen database of internet artworks, just with some character presets attached to it. 

This event is, as I’ve mentioned, china exclusive. Very few people know about it on twitter or Reddit. Google honkai star rail ai web event and you can pull up a small twitter discussion which has the images of the web event. 

The CN comments under the announcement post seems to be like pretty split, but the majority outside of that specific post either don’t care or don’t know or are bots bought by mihoyo or is fooled into thinking that mihoyo owns all artwork behind the program. Some vocal and ignorant minorities are literally defending mihoyo saying “ohhhh but they own all the copyright y’all are just haters” or “hahahah L artists are doomed to be replaced”. Like thanks this deffo adds to the shitty reputation of this company and ai art users. It honestly shows how ai art is perceived, especially when done by a massively influential company with its users at its fingertips.

According to their website, they’ve generated more than 350,000 images just 2 days after the web event launched. 

The fact that they chose to do this so quickly and without hesitation makes me extremely afraid. It doesn’t appear that there’s nearly enough outrage for them to shut it down, and people will most likely forget about it once the event is over. I’m pretty certain this is a publicity stunt of sorts, but this of all things???? They’re associating their new title with ai art right after launch with literally no shame.

What’s more terrifying is that Mihoyo is a biiiiig star in the genre and other companies will most likely follow in its steps. 

I was really enjoying the game, but now it hurts my soul. I want to play and engage with the people from the fandom but my moral compass says that for now, there’s no way I can support this. I’ve since deleted it. It’s clear that I’m in the minority, though.

And yeah, since it’s not officially in the game itself, I don’t even know how “bad” it is, if you have any opinions I’d love to hear them. 

Edit - for grammar and clarity, I wrote this in bed when I woke up and was just groggy & pissed off lol. Also, it’s hard to access details of the situation if you don’t speak Chinese/ have a Chinese social media, so feel free to reach out if you’re also a disappointed (ex)fan and I’d be glad to provide some details.",32,84,0.95,2023-04-29 20:52:42,Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/13327qq/mihoyo_and_ai/,kyinhell,646

170,ArtistLounge,132jlzb,"Please, stop catastrophizing AI. Instead, help people getting motivation.","I came to Reddit (not only this sub) for checking how people are dealing with the whole AI ""art crisis"", and most posts or comments I see tell people the same stuff:

1. AI is going to make everyone poor, kill all digital art market in a few years, if not even traditional art. We are all doomed because it's growing exponentially, just wait for it.

2. AI ""art"" is shit, and will always be. That's NOT the common sense perception. That's usually what good artists or people who have deep studies in it, who have trained eyes, can see. Most people see it as pretty pieces, and pay as much attention to it as a pretty drawing for a random artist in the internet. Hell, I even saw hundreds of people thinking that the whole Balenciaga video meme generation is truly _beautiful_. Besides, many people drool over realism for fast consumption, which is the most optimized aspect of AI now.

Please, instead of making people even more anxious, I want to remember everyone WHY we make art. It's to _express ourselves_. To tell stories of our perceptions and experiences of the world.

Although technique is crucial, it's NOT why we started. And technique is the only thing a machine can have. You can even ask ChatGPT about it — mind you, I work with software development, and I often use it for studying my code.

Remember when you were a kid, and you draw that weird stick figure with a crooked face. For your parents, that was pure art. It is way, way more significant than a semi realistic rendered cute waifu similar to thousand others. Only us, humans, have the power to tell meaning stories, doesn't matter what tools we use.

Personally, I started drawing and painting because I wanted to express myself, to distract my mind out of the terrible things I was facing, and, also, because my girlfriend loved to see it. For her, it was the most beautiful thing, although I'm just a beginner. I often create things because I love her and want to impress her showing my effort.

It mentioned AI art, begging for a drawing, but “cool” was also mentioned, as it is too bland, superficial for the effort put into the art. 

What bugs me is that I often drop a “cool” when I’m not familiar enough with the art or artist to make a worthy comment. 

That lead me to wonder what the opposite of that is, what we wish for hear when we share our art!

I want to ask, am i doing something wrong?, why is that i can't get any clients?, it's been 22 days of this month and i haven't got any offer or i get those clients that only have 50$ and wants a full splash art with 3 characters in semi-realistic style.

You can see my portfolio on my profile, i don't want to post it so the Mods dont think i'm trying to promote, but i don't think i'm a bad artist, so why i can't get clients?, i post as much as i can on other sub reddits and discord groups but it just seems like nobody wants to hire me.

173,ArtistLounge,12im8db,How to get money back after hiring scammers?,"I made a post on here and I hired 10 different artists for a project.  I had been so used to fiverr and people sending me AI artwork, that I was thinking that's what I should be worried about.   I'd look at their portfolio and it would look like hand made art. If they said they dont use AI, I'd order a commission.  After a few days, it started becoming obvious which artists were real people and which ones were scammers.   All the people that were active on reddit and obviously real people have been great! On 4 of them though, things just weren't adding up.  Then I checked their accounts on reddit and their accounts were all about a month old.  When they sent me rough sketches of the art.  All 4 of them had the same style of sketch. It looks like a computer trying to fake a pencil drawing.  A BAD pencil drawing. The art is nothing like we discussed. Composition is nothing like we talked about, subject isn't really matching and overall is just comically, bad. It's obvious to me that theu are putting our conversation in AI and having it come up with something.  After going back and reading our conversations, I think I've been talking to bots.  Also, I didn't notice it before but two of them sent me the same piece in their portfolio as something they custom painted for a client.I'm 100% these 4 are scammers and 90% sure they aren't even real people.  


If they were just bad artists and i was unhappy with the work,  I would have no problem paying them. Someone put in effort and I was just unhappy with their work. These are literal scams



I'm unsure what to do.  They have sent me their rough sketches but not the final ""art.""  I paid with PayPal goods and services.  PayPal doesn't offer refunds on ""custom"" work.    How should I try to word my dispute or going about it?  Is there a way to get my money back?  I don't think PayPal would understand if I said they were ""scammers.""

I have been interested in a visual arts career my whole life but a lack of guidance, support, knowledge, the right advice and self-confidence has kept me from making it a reality. (I'm 31 btw so it's about time I take control of that!) I'm sick of falling in to roles I don't really care for just to play a game of how long can I keep treading for fear of drowning before throwing in the towel...

My professional background is admin/reception, retail, hospitality, hairdressing & modelling. All have felt wrong to me.

I have scholarly training in visual arts (1yr cert 4 design & illustration, and after school art classes from primary school through highschool)
As well as my own practices on the side

My strongest suit is Automatism paired with Pareidolia, as well as fantasy and surrealism - I work with most tools (would love to learn oils and digital properly)
I can also copy like a scanner/printer and copy from real life, I can also put an expressionist or cartoonish spin on anything I want. I understand the principles and mostly everything about art - I just lack the dedicated time to work on it!
Basically I can do a lot, I'm just not properly trained digitally

I know what I predominantly do and don't want in an art career
• I would love to work in a group of like-minded individuals collaborating on a big artistic goal together, (think Ghibli movie, tabletop and video game illustration and concept design, set painting, gallery collaborations, etc)
• I can also see myself working as a solo entrepreneur in un-contracted hours illustrating books, cards, prints, originals, etc.
• I'm not interested in anything that is mostly tech oriented like UI/UX or Graphic Design, I find it too structured and dull

Like everyone I'm worried about the effect of ai on my ability to get much work in future, fingers crossed the big ""guns"" are making some changes for us underdogs

Would love to know how you might hop/skip/jump from full time corporate to eventually full time Artist whilst also paying rent & bills

175,ArtistLounge,13422ym,"No, not everyone can become an artist","Firstly, I do believe that drawing is something that anyone can really learn (in theory). Problem? Many, many people can't because they don't have that kind of discipline, determination and willpower to become an artist. And that was exactly me.

I searched for how to learn to draw, I saw an insane amount of different tutorials, advice and instructions on how to learn to draw, how to draw this and that, how to improve and yet... It didn't help at all. I messaged a bunch of artists, how they improved, how they learned to draw, what advice they would give me... In fact, I always did and looked up everything related to drawing and did not actually draw anything. My art didn't look like I imagined. I wanted to be at the level of those people who had been doing it for several years, all their lives... I wanted the final product, I didn't enjoy the process. I bought an ipad for drawing and when I saw that my art looked 'bad', thought the ipad was the problem and a year later I bought a graphic tablet with a screen (god). Needlessly. Cliché, but really it's not about the equipment you use, but about your skills. 

And let me tell you one thing - I didn't fall in love with the process of making art, I fell in love with the IDEA of making art and being an artist and that's a big difference.

So while I believe that anyone can learn to draw, I don't believe that everyone has what it takes to truly become an artist. Sometimes it's good to think about whether a person really likes drawing or just wants to be admired.",138,175,0.77,2023-04-30 23:27:27,General Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/13422ym/no_not_everyone_can_become_an_artist/,debrassiepisode,284

180,ArtistLounge,12riofc,Movement to watermark AI generated content.,"Just wanted to inform you guys that we're kicking off a movement to try to pressure companies that create generative AI to watermark their content (steganographically\[the encrypted & hard to reverse engineer kind\] or using novel methods).

It's getting harder to detect the noise remnants in AI-generated images and detectors don't work all the time.

 Many companies already have methods to detect their generations but they haven't released the services publically.

We're trying to fight the problem from its roots.

That's for proprietary AI models, in terms of open-source models we're aiming to get the companies that host these open-source models like HuggingFace etc. to make it compulsory to have a watermarking code snippet (preferably an API of some sorts so that the code can't be cracked).

I understand that watermarks are susceptible to augmentation attacks but with research and pressure, a resilient watermarking system will emerge and obviously, any system to differentiate art is better than nothing.

The ethical landscape is very gray when it comes to AI art as a lot of it is founded on data that was acquired without consent but it's going to take time to resolve the legal and ethical matters and until then a viable solution would be to at least quarantine or isolate AI art from human art, that way at least human expression can retain its authenticity in a world where AI art keeps spawning.

So tweet about it and try to pressure companies to do so.

182,ArtistLounge,12yy2t0,This subreddit isn’t good for anyone intermediate or higher,"I haven’t met any assholes here or anything, everyone’s pretty helpful. I joined because I’m mainly on Reddit and wanted to be a part of an artistic community on here. It’s great here when you’re talking about art in general, like innovations, sharing tips. But not for artists that are finally starting to spread their wings and go into their own big projects.

If I followed people’s advice here, I’d never feel ready and I’d never feel confident in my abilities. It’s a sub where everyone is assumed to be beginners by default when they post, you can mention that you’ve already studied through the books people always suggest for new artists (Framed Ink, Animator’s Survival Kit, Understanding Comics, a slew of anatomy books and color theory books) but it’s not enough, you’re still new, practice more.

It’s like people push their insecurities of publishing their own works and possibly failing onto other people, even to the people that are confident enough to look at the possibility of failure and not feel nervous.

And I get it, being an artist sucks, it’s stressful, even if you do somehow make it and turn it into a job, it doesn’t get easier from there. But it doesn’t feel like a sub where we can help each other grow, but cry about the things that upset us as an artist. 

I’ve been realizing more and more of this sub’s negative impact on my progress and I can’t recommend anyone that’s ready to get out there and do things to stay here. I’d recommend finding a space outside of the sub where people will listen to you and actually try to understand you, because at the end of the day, it’s a REDDIT community and the same issues that grow in other subs can grow in this one as well.

Edit: I forgot to mention, I don’t come here myself for help, mainly vent about something weird going on art wise, but all that I’m talking about is something that I see often here.",106,143,0.78,2023-04-26 01:21:15,General Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/12yy2t0/this_subreddit_isnt_good_for_anyone_intermediate/,NecroCannon,336
183,ArtistLounge,13bjlyu,Is it rude to point out a mistake in someone’s art?,"I saw some are that someone posted on tumblr and it’s really good. Like *really* good, super detailed, I can tell they put a ton of thought into it, they posted several paragraphs explaining the significance of some of the details they added. 

I was zoomed all the way in so I could inspect it and try to take it all in and I noticed that the woman in the piece has two left feet. Literally, both of the feet are left ones. Is that something I should point out? It’s digital art, and while I don’t claim to be an artist, I have dabbled a bit and it would be much easier to fix on of the feet digitally than it would with something like paint on a canvas. I’m just not sure if it’s acceptable to point that out? I’d rather know if it were me but I’m autistic and can’t really tell where to draw the line on telling people things I’d want to know.

If I do get more awareness around my art then what..? Am I meant to just survive off getting views and likes? (Financially) if I put my time and effort into releasing my music or a visual piece then what? Everything just feels like a game. Everyone just wants to be cool and famous, everyone wants to do art because it makes you cool. Do these people even enjoy art for the peace that it brings? The communities it builds? The people that it has saved? Even now when I try to post consistently I feel this blockage inside of me like I'm throwing my head into the game without really having any direction as to how to even survive off my art. Things just feel so oversaturated and I cant shake off that feeling. Everyone and their third cousin is an artist now, and not that it's necessarily a bad thing but the race to get somewhere to gain some type of recognition just feels so cringe to me. Is there something wrong with me? Am I just being annoying?

188,ArtistLounge,12tnk0h,Is it wrong to recolor a commission i ordered?,"I recently commissioned a talented artist to draw my friend and i's game characters together, i am not very experienced at commissioning and i didn't mention my friend is black and my character is tan (the skintone in the game was very limited so our characters ended up having the same skintone). They did not send me any in progress pictures or anything like that so once i sent the payment i didnt get any picture updates until they were completely done with it. The first one was amazing, it was so good and exceeded every expectation i had! Except for the fact that my friend was the wrong skintone, i apologized heavily and offered to pay more for them to fix it but they said they could just redo the skin quickly. The next day they contacted me saying they had to redo the entire drawing. There was no background or anything super complicated detail wise, so i wasn't sure if it was a hard fix or not but i offered to pay the price of another commission for all the trouble but they declined saying it was okay and that its no problem. 


Two weeks later and still no picture updates or anything, just a message saying they were done. They sent me the finished result and it was a completely different drawing with a completely different artstyle, it barely resembled the previous work as well as different shading and coloring and detailing. The second take was much less detailed and completely different. I felt a little upset for the change in artstyle because i was not let known of this beforehand nor did i get any physical updates of the drawing itself until they were done. 

I don't want to bother them and be a karen by demanding them to redraw it for a third time but i also dont want to use the second drawing as our profile pictures because the quality on the first one is much better. I wanted to edit the first picture and tweak the skintone so that its a little darker, is that wrong of me??

UPDATE: Here is a link to the pictures for anyone who wants to see it!! please lmk if its traced or ai or something, im not saying the second take is bad whatsoever its beautiful!! but its not consistent with that i asked for/ not the style they have on their page [commission pictures](https://imgur.com/a/Y1x1Xig)",39,42,0.94,2023-04-21 05:29:40,Social Media/Commissions/Business,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/12tnk0h/is_it_wrong_to_recolor_a_commission_i_ordered/,fleshcults,408
189,ArtistLounge,136wanl,I feel like my art is boring and emotionless.,"It's taken years, but I finally feel like I'm at a good point with the technical capability of my art. The thing is, despite being well drawn, I don't think there's anything interesting about my art. I usually do portraits of animals or furries, neither of which seem to have any sort of emotional value. 

One of my graphic design professors once described my work as ""dull"" - not as an insult but as a quality of it. I think it meant that my art used muted colors, and a minimal subject matter, and just kinda had a depressing feel to it. Being told that was actually really inspiring for a moment since it gave me a quality to work for in my art, until I realized that ""dull"" carries the weight of being uninteresting. I've tried to incorporate emotion into my work more recently, but it still feels devoid of anything and childish if done improperly.

I want to express myself through my art but don't know how. I've been feeling stuck like this for a long time now and it's really getting to me. I apologize for the rant-y post but this is something I finally had to talk about. I would greatly appreciate any insight about how you or other artists make their work feel more emotionally impactful, and less uninteresting.

192,ArtistLounge,12o9z99,"""How To Be an Artist on Social Media Without Destroying Your Soul""","Social media is essentially advertising. It sucks. Social media also sucks and hurts our mental health. So **treat your social media time like it’s work.**

* Establish boundaries. Social media is engineered to get inside your head. Don’t let it.

* Re-vizualize your accounts, not as yours, but as *your business’s.*

* Unfollow (or mute) friends, family, and any distractions like meme accounts. Try not to feel bad about it. Accounts are not people, and social media is designed to distract you. 

* Network! Follow accounts in a similar field and interact with them. You can do this authentically without being weird. 

**Schedule dedicated work time** for managing the accounts, making posts, responding to DMs, etc.

Possible methods include:

* Setting a screentime or digital wellbeing timer to prevent lingering after the “work” is done.

* Uninstalling the app when done “working” for the day, and reinstalling it when needed.

* Checking in only from your web browser, where you can block ads and other distractions.

* Use third party software to schedule posts.

* Using a second phone (or tablet, you probably won’t need a data plan) as a “work” phone that won’t be carried with you everywhere. Keep the bad apps on that device.

**Encourage your existing followers to follow you somewhere less toxic and that you have control over.**

* Newsletters are the hotness right now, some platforms allow for easy monetization for your fans to directly support your work.

* Mastodon is a small but growing network, and not owned by a corporation. Very counterculture. 

* Be careful not go anywhere that won’t let you bring your followers with you if you leave.

**In short:**

1. Open the app

2. Post your shit out there, you rockstar you.

3. Check your DM’s

4. Log off before the algorithm can get its tendrils into your brain.

…Which brings us to the most important part…

**For the love of God, don’t fret over likes!**

Social media algorithms want to nudge you into making generic art by rewarding it with likes. They want to trick artists into generating simple, easy-to-digest-content that will keep the other users hooked without challenging anyone intellectually. Don’t let them get away with it. It’s one thing to Airbnb-ify your art for money, it’s another to do it for imaginary internet points that also make your art boring. Remember: *Like counts are not tied in any meaningful way to how much people actually like your work.* The companies decide which posts get attention and which don't. The “game” is rigged.

All day I keep thinking about the possibility, how I could develop it, the color, and composition, etc. etc. So I can't focus at work.

194,ArtistLounge,12wlhh3,I learned a lesson; I will never offer my art or undermine the work again.," I offered an acquaintance free art after they showed me what I considered poorly done art that they paid for for their book. They told me that the artist had ghosted them and they haven't been able to get a hold of them. I pitied them and told them that I will help without pay. A few days later they were asking if I finished or how the artwork was going. Anyway long story, I haven't been able to get the art done in a timely manner and since I felt ashamed of not being able to get it done I made excuses like I believe I struggle with adhd and that is making it difficult for me to focus which is a sincere excuse. When I finished the first piece of art they asked me to redo it because it appeared too dark when printed out so I sat at their table and painstakingly try to lighten up the drawing; as I was doing that they kept trying to zoom in on my tablet and accidentally erasing my progress which really frustrated me. Now this past month they been trying to get me to go to their house for ""an art day"" so I can finish their art work. They said that they are willing to give me gas money. I told my mom how frustrated I was and she told me to block them but I feel like I cannot go back on my word. I had written this text yesterday but haven't had the guts to send it to them: ""I think I undertook a task that is too big for me. I don't really want to go to your house and have an art day. I need to work to pay my bills. When I make a good sketch, the work I put into it can be a full day's work. Digital art is something I am not skilled at, and making this drawing has required me to learn new techniques that I didn't know before. I have difficulty saying no to people, and I also tend to undermine my work.

There was exactly one that I felt good about upon its completion, but after a couple days, it just wasn't up to my expectations.

I know it takes way longer than a few months to get good, but since I'm still a student, I can't dedicate as much time to art as I'd like, so I want to know what to expect going forward as an amateur artist.

How long will it take for me to feel like I'm a good artist, and how much effort does it take?

Thanks!

edit: thank you all for your sage advice.

197,ArtistLounge,1375twe,I feel so strongly compelled to make art but I cannot actually do it.,"I like pixel art. I’ve made some things I’m really proud of. But they are exceedingly far between. Because the times I even attempt it at all are very rare. 

I get an idea. I get this urge to make it a reality. I open up my software and I end up staring at a white screen for hours and wasting entire evenings back to back. 

I’ve tried referencing things. I’ve tried coming up with themes. I’ve tried this. I’ve tried that. Nothing can get me to make it. Like there is advice out there for artists block, but there is absolutely no point in which I am not “blocked”. 

I feel like I resent art in a weird way. As if I’m defeated by it or something, and I have to make something I can be proud of. If I can’t, then I’m crushed and can’t even live with myself. So I just avoid making it altogether. 

I went to college for art for a while. I loved it at first but when it became something I had to do in order to market it or get an assignment done, I hated it. 

But now i can’t even sleep some nights thinking about how I wanted to make something cool and failed to even come up with the most basic beginnings of a concept. 

My entire mood and state of mind can hinge on it. And the fact that 90% of the time I attempt to make art, I in fact do not, has led me to very lengthy periods of despair. And I don’t mean to be melodramatic. That is the word I would describe it with. Totally crushed. Lost any sense of self worth. 

And so I avoid it like alcoholics avoid beer. I look at it. I think “maybe I’ll attempt something…” and have to actively pull myself away towards something else because I know exactly how everything is going to on out.

Now, I see more and more spam on social media than ever before, from NFT blaggers to AI. It is like the doors blasted open and the lowest common denominator spilled in. I have been doing this since 2006, and whilst there have been changes over the years, only now do I see an empty nothingness surrounding online art. It feels more difficult to connect with actual art loving humans than ever before, thanks to the over-commodification of things. 

Has anyone else noticed this?

I feel that now is the time to take art offline and market locally, or at least in real life. It used to be quite simple to find a niche, to connect with art lovers, but it now feels totally washed out. There's no depth. Every second comment on my posts is NFT spam, and I say this as someone who does well, so god help anyone starting out.

I (30F) was raised homeschooled by my mother (50F) in the 90s and early 2000s. She and I didn't get along well since I was 9ish she was verbally and physically abusive, so like a kid does, I tried to do things that would gain her affection, one of those things was art. She loves art and anytime I would make something and show her she would get happy with me.
I got really good at it, my profs in university always put me at the top of the class and showed my art to everyone to show ""how it's done"", shiver.
So now I feel like I can't even bring myself to do any form of art. In therapy my therapist wanted me to do more expressive stuff, I showed it to my husband and he's like wow it's too horrible to even look at. 
I know it might be good for me to do more art but it honestly just makes me feel sick and queasy, dissociated and sad. 
I love watching montages on IG but that's as far as I go in terms of creating

204,ArtistLounge,13axmvl,People giving backhanded compliments about your art... Happened to you before/How do you cope?,"I don't really have anyone to show my art to who seems to show any genuine interest in, but I have one friend who seemed to be interested up until recently. I like to share my art with people (especially other artists, but I had a falling out with my artist friend group), so I showed them one of new drawings today. Upon showing it to them they said ""hmm, it's kinda messy. I'd give it a 7.7"".

When they said this it really upset me. I have a lot of self doubt about my art so it made me feel shitty. I just said thank you and left it at that, but it's kinda put me in a bad mood for the rest of the day. I know that they're not saying it's bad, but it felt like them pointing out the flaws (it was a sketch, so of course it was messy), and then giving a rating was backhanded and indifferent. 

Anyways, I guess what I'm asking if any of you guys have run into stuff like this before too and what you do when this happens/how you cope with the negative feelings it may bring you. I don't have any other artist friends to ask so I thought maybe some of you guys have run into something like this before.

205,ArtistLounge,13aell4,Considering Quitting Commissions,"For context, I've primarily used Instagram as a platform before deciding to use other platforms to promote my art commissions and they've been open since December 2022. Before opening, I got plenty of advice from various experienced commission artists to ensure the most optimal experience for both the artist and patron. I don't know if it's too soon to say right now, but I'm considering quitting commission work.

So far, I've only come across scams (the good old ""draw my pet for my child and I'll pay an ungodly amount beyond your prices"" is all too familiar to me), bot accounts, and one client who did nothing but attempt to haggle. Even on the other platforms, I haven't found much luck. In one particular post, I got a reply saying that my prices did not match the quality of the works I presented. Whether this was to attack me or help me out, this made me feel like my artwork was horrible and not worth selling at all. The silver lining to all of this is that there were zero losses thanks to my TOS. However, I have made zero sales in the months I have been open for commissions.

To be fair, my audience is minuscule on Instagram (\~80 followers) but I do need the money to be able to provide for myself. It's been difficult to get a job position, and the job I currently have is minimum wage. That and two other things are stopping me from giving up so easily:

1. I've had two people say they would like to commission me in the future.
2. I find purpose and meaning in my artwork and am eager to expand my audience.

Maybe if I try other platforms that are more art-oriented/art commission and/or are free/have high control of bot accounts, it could help me out a lot. I know it's inevitable to come across bot accounts and unpleasant patrons, but I don't think it's normal to have the only clients be that. 

I'm interested to hear your thoughts on this, as I don't know what to do.",18,8,0.75,2023-05-07 08:59:48,Social Media/Commissions/Business,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/13aell4/considering_quitting_commissions/,Violet_Blossoms74,346
206,ArtistLounge,13ci9ks,What’s up with the comment section in a lot of art posts?,"Hi, everyone.

Despite the internet being a melting pot of scum and villainy, I still feel the need to ask about this. Why is it that there are certain art posts that elicit such… strange(?) responses from users? Typically, the art is of an attractive woman, either nude or partially and the comments are almost always quite vile in some cases and snobbish in others. 

Not all comments, obviously, but there’s often a lot of tutting and dismissive comments being made about “just another jerk-off material post”. Don’t get me wrong, I understand that female nude art dominates most online spaces and that can be problematic in some cases. But why do you think that every post elicits the same or similar responses? And if you’ve ever, or would ever in the future, post a piece that features nude or suggestively nude women, would you ignore it or engage with it?

Second question, because I don’t want to flood the subreddit with posts, is do you feel that the artist has to justify the choices they make to you? For example, if they post an illustration of a witch in a bikini, does it matter to you why they did that? Does it matter which direction their torso faces as it relates to the viewer? 

I’m finding myself becoming increasingly more interested in the responses to these particular posts than the posts themselves and a part of me wants to post similar work to see how people react. That’s the lizard part of my brain that wants to see how hot the oven really is or whether a fence is truly electrified and I’ll likely ignore it.

But anyway, feel free to answer one of these many questions. I’ll stop now before I truly ramble.",12,11,0.74,2023-05-09 10:05:59,General Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/13ci9ks/whats_up_with_the_comment_section_in_a_lot_of_art/,Brinkelai,292

I write things down and often have multiple projects/concepts floating at once, it’s not a linear progress, but sometimes I will get frustrated that I’ve spent more time doing that than actually being productive, so I’ll go for a walk and then make myself dive into something random in my sketchbook, a “just do don’t think” kind of exercise but that will then inspire me further into new ideas and concepts I will then spend hours pondering and planning and researching.

But in first year, we get made to do the dumbest shit no exaggeration. I have nothing against conceptual and abstract art, but I got let in based on a portfolio full of highly technical illustrations with anatomy n lighting and portraits, I get here, and I am being graded this year on how well I can make work that VISUALLY a 5 year old can make. And people are really liking my work as I can convey complex ideas and themes extremely well through this apparently, but I have no interest in it. I don’t wanna be making visually simple sculptures and paintings that critique society in profound ways. Again I’m not shitting on this kind of art, I understand them and they are important, but I’m not in it for that. Everything we do has to have some profound message behind it and it is pissing me off to be honest, not all art has to be changing the world.

I've been an aspiring digital artist for awhile now but haven't made much progress due to my issues with self-doubt, envy, pessimism and general negative emotions. The thing is I don't think it's my inherent personality that lead to these problems and I wanted to get some second opinions.

I grew up with a loving mother and father, even if they could be a bit pushy with regards to success but what parent doesn't want to see their child succeed? The issue comes from my older sister, who has BPD. From around the time she got into middle school, I became the regular target of her bullying, being put down, told I'm worthless, etc...this has continued into the present day (we're both in our early 20s now) and though she has times where she isn't as bad, I'll seemingly always be the worst thing in the world to her. I wasn't entirely sure if bullying could lead to problems getting off the ground in the art field but as someone who has basically had any self-confidence broken down into nothing, I figured I'd may as well ask.",20,7,0.71,2023-05-04 16:22:03,Mental Health,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/137kj3w/bullying_leading_to_art_struggles/,TheGraveKnight,199

211,ArtistLounge,12xoa65,Something I realized about social media(After a post flopped no less lol),"So I finished a piece yesterday, and was really happy with how it came out. It looked exactly how I wanted it to, and I was sure it'd do well. So I posted it at night, and then woke up in the morning to check it. 12 likes. I put in a lot of effort into it and it only got like 12 likes. And damn I got upset. Always wanted to have a big community like some bigger artists on twitter, with people commenting and liking, always being able to hear what they thought, yet with interactions like that It'd never happen. It sucked especially since a post a few days earlier I made a post that got 3 times the likes.

But then, I looked at the people who liked the post, and I saw a lot of familiar faces. Almost every time I posted, some of them would always interact. One of them even commented and told me how it looked cool! That's when I realized, I got a small group of mutuals and friends who would always interact with my posts. It's kinda nice. It's like a small version of what I want, but with people I actively talk to and know. I was getting what I wanted, and I didn't even realize it because how small the numbers were.

And I know that it's hard to resist the nagging feeling of not being adequate enough because of your small following, I even made a comic depicting my thoughts a few days ago. But it's alright. I have the group of friends I want, and I'm happy with how my art is. And for any artists thinking if they make their art better they'll get more followers, lemme suggest this. Take your most recent piece, and imagine that someone else made it. Would you still like it then? If yes, congrats, you've done what you should as an artist-make things you love. And as for the follower count thing, a guy in a discord I'm in was talking about that. He said that despite him having over 7k followers he only gets like 100-200 likes per post on an average day. So even in followers, you aren't guaranteed to get that big 1k likes per post.

So try not to focus on the numbers. Perhaps they'll come eventually. Perhaps they won't. But what matters most is you enjoy your time on social media and enjoy your art, whether you be popular or not.",13,68,0.99,2023-04-24 19:30:17,Social Media/Commissions/Business,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/12xoa65/something_i_realized_about_social_mediaafter_a/,JPrimal64,414

I think the most accurate examples I can use is that I’d love to create art like Wayne Barlowe’s illustrations of hell, and the works of equietum.art on Instagram. I want to avoid just making copies of their works, though.

224,ArtistLounge,12wwwx7,For some reason… this isn’t fun.,"I’m making a comic. It’s my middle ground since I can’t make a long running cartoon series with just me behind everything (and without it taking up so much of my life ffs, it would be 1 episode a year or something)

But it’s like I can’t put myself in it, I have drafted 2 books worth of comic pages (200-300 pg.) and still have yet to have a draft that just speaks to me.

I am PASSIONATE about animated shows and movies, everytime I watch them I study everything as I watch. The directing, how the soundtrack flows with the scenes, why it made me feel a certain way, and I rewatch my favorites constantly, just observing how they build up these story lines, foreshadowed plot twists, and how, from the beginning, the movie sways your emotions. I love animation and how expressive and beautiful it is, to a point that I can’t watch anything live action. Outside of YouTube I legitimately only watch anime and western animated movies.

Just typing that, I felt myself brighten up with joy. 

But I just can’t replicate that feeling in comics…  there’s no movement, no soundtrack, and while my composition is becoming really great from studying these amazingly directed shows, it’s the only thing that’s sparking joy when I make comics. I’ve been flipping throughout so many comics and manga to find ones that speaks to me, and almost no comic artist or mangaka’s work do, they all just feel so flat, like the art is there to just visually show you what’s happening and not crafting an immersive experience.

There’s a few mangaka that do speak to me, Asano Inio and Yusuke Murata. Asano’s works feel so real and dark, it’s like I can imagine what soundtrack his scenes would have because of just how well he composes things. Yusuke is amazing with drawing motion, flow, and action, I never seen a manga so good with action that an anime adaptation probably wouldn’t still do it justice. Both of them are great at drawing these worlds that feel so 3D and lived in, apparently Murata even sculpts his monsters for reference. I’ll start studying their works and see if maybe I can get inspired to find a way to combine Asano’s directing with Murata’s action",19,8,0.79,2023-04-24 03:48:51,Mental Health,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/12wwwx7/for_some_reason_this_isnt_fun/,NecroCannon,381
225,ArtistLounge,12ugd2p,Falling in and out of love with art.,"Hey everyone. I just wanted to share how I was feeling when it came to art and potentially pursuing it.

I have always drawn since I was very, very young. When I was younger, I always wanted to be an artist, of course, I didn’t really know what kind. But as I got older, I started looking at particular areas to possibly go into as I started to find my own style and figured out what I liked (Character Design, Concept Art, Illustration, etc.).

However, ever since I graduated high school, I found it extremely difficult to want to pursue art. I looked at art schools during my time in high school and was immediately dejected and discouraged when I realized that I didn’t have a portfolio of what art schools were looking for. My art style would never get me into an art school, I thought.

I draw a lot of manga/anime-styled illustrations since that’s one of my main interests and has heavily influenced my art style. I thought that maybe I could be a manga-ka, a manga artist/writer/creator, but learned that they make literal pennies for their work.

Just yesterday, I had completely broken down in tears saying that I hated art. Sometimes I wish I was a math nerd or was determined enough to get some sort of medical degree. I asked myself what the purpose of drawing was and cried and cried.

And yet, I always go back to it. My mom always tells me that she thought I wanted to pursue art whenever I tell her that I wanted to go to college for something entirely different. I respond with, “I literally picked the worst hobby to try and make a career out of.” Or, “I can’t make a career out of my art/with the art that I draw.”

I’m tired of this hobby but I can never let it go. I don’t really know what the purpose of this post was. I guess I just need to write down my thoughts and throw them to the wind.

229,ArtistLounge,12h0rxs,"I just ordered $280 worth of physical items/merch, was this stupid","I've always really wanted to sell on etsy and eventually on my own website, specifically my own art in stickers, keychains, prints, etc.

And then I found out about a local anime convention happening and I wanted to apply, but I didn't have much time to get merch made. So I made a few designs and applied for artist alley just to give it a go. And I contacted the production company to see if they could make everything I wanted in time for the possible convention. They said they could but its best to order asap, so I didn't have time to wait to hear back from the artist alley team to see if I got accepted, and had to order. 

My fall back is that if the convention rejects me, I could sell my stuff on etsy. I've sold digital products on etsy before, it's a bit shit and easy to get lost in the crowd so I am worried. I'm just hoping physical items will sell better. Also, I don't get much social media interaction, the most followers I have is on twitter at 230 so I doubt my audience will go buy stuff off my etsy if they see me post about it, I'd have to rely on people on etsy seeing my work. 

I worked hard doing lots of commissions to save up money for this purchase and I'm so worried that I've just wasted my money. If I don't get to sell at this convention, I may never make the money back let alone any profit by just using etsy. And there's no other conventions in my country. I feel like I rushed, and should have grown my social following before doing all this but it's too late now.

230,ArtistLounge,12ihgz6,What happened to Art?,"Hello fellow artists! I am a young aspiring illustrator/concept artist and have had quite a bit on my mind lately and would love to hear some opinions on some of my questions and views of contemporary art. 

I know that there are so many great artists these days and see so much talent in all fields. Although, when speaking of fine art and contemporary art that I see in galleries, auctions, and museums, I feel as if the pieces are lacking in many ways. The pieces seem to create some emotions and I understand that they are attempting to make us think about issues and art as a whole but look as if anyone could have made them and lack almost any technical skill whatsoever. People claim they have meaning but the meaning is completely subjective and completely up to the viewer in many cases. Why is it that art has to be so vague? Is it because people feel smart when they come up with a meaning for a bunch of paint smeared across a canvas? While looking through an online gallery such as artsy, I was in disbelief by the amount of money people were asking for pieces that looked as if a 12 year olds made them, sure they have meaning and context behind them, but why not achieve meaning through something that actually took skill and ability with a medium? Keep in mind I'm not talking about all artists, just a good amount that I see selling to rich people, and it's just my opinion.

I hear in many places that technical skill is not interesting, and that photo-realism is dead. I completely agree that recreating an image is very boring and could be done by many people. Although, photo-realism is not what I am talking about when I say technical skill. What I mean is the ability to produce things that do not exist anywhere in the world except the artists mind in a way that is relatable and distinguishable to the viewer. Cameras can still not capture things anywhere near the way we see the world through our own eyes. Why is it that fine art seems to have completely dropped the idea that art should be beautiful in a sense of representation of the world around us? While looking through modern art, rarely do I see a figure with correct proportions/anatomy, any use of perspective, or correct uses of light and color. I understand the rebellious act surrounding this, but it seems to have become an excuse to create art that does not look good at all. 

For example, a Piet Mondrian painting of squares can sell for 50 million, or the same for Barnett Newmanns blue painting with the white line. Then compare these paintings to something such as Ahasuerus at the End of the World by Adolf Hiremy-Hirschl, or something even older like Géricault's Raft of the Medusa. Both of these random examples are able to achieve deep meaning and express beauty, while the other modern art examples do make you think, they look like garbage. The only reason I'm comparing these very different examples is to ask the question of why art with beauty and spirit is no longer praised in the current fine art world. If either of my examples from pre-modern art were to have not been created until today, they would have very little value in comparison to my examples of modern art. I think that this is sad and the reason I ask, what has happened to art?

This problem seemed to have seeped into art education as well. My drawing professor couldn't answer my simple questions about perspective, and my digital art professor couldn't answer my questions about creating shortcuts and brushes in photoshop, along with many other issues that could be discussed in a future post. I dropped out after one semester, so I didn't waste too much money.  

Again, this is all just my opinion, and although I have learned quite a bit about art history as well as contemporary art, I am only 20 years old and still have so much to learn which is why I would love to hear some of your thoughts. Even though I am saying this, there is an incredible amount of skill and talent in fine art and contemporary art, and I could never think of many of their ideas and push boundaries like Piet Mondrian or Barnett Newmann who were mentioned above. I just feel like modern art has pushed away and left little space for artists that create beautiful, spiritual, and moving art just because traditional methods are no longer as appreciated.

234,ArtistLounge,12zc1hs,I enjoy my art style but I want the kind of art that people think is amazing?,"Just putting it into a few words is a bit difficult.
I’m a somewhat spotty reader of Manhwa/ webtoons and grew up reading mangas instead. It is said that what you grow up liking tends to influence your art style and I believe in my case, it is somewhat true.

However, I noticed that my art style likes to change and my satisfaction with my art changes as well depending on what I’m currently fixated with.
For example, when I’d read a webtoon like Purple Hyacinth, I Love Yoo, and even The Blind Prince, I noticed my art would slightly alter itself to the features I love the most of those comics.
When I read who made me a princess, secret lady, or Stepmother’s Marchen, I found myself frustrated with my art.
I asked myself why my art is so flat and simple when manhwa art is almost 3D, on a different level.

It can be because these manhwa artists are very skilled at anatomy, perspective, color theory, etc. but even then, with webtoon artists, they seem to have the same grasps but simplify their art for the sake of comic making.

How can I make it so that I am confident with my art when I want to draw beautifully cinematic pieces as well as have my own distinct style that isn’t so manhwa like? 

My art style is def more shoujo inspired because that’s what I’ve felt happy drawing in… but I want to have the kind of atmosphere that colored manhwa pages give.",21,8,0.73,2023-04-26 12:26:32,Positivity/Success/Inspiration,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/12zc1hs/i_enjoy_my_art_style_but_i_want_the_kind_of_art/,Illustrious-Tough767,249
235,ArtistLounge,13dntdu,I did my first art raffle and I got a few worries,"Hello everyone! As the title says, I'm currently running my first ever art raffle on Twitter, and I'd love some advice on some worries I got.  
The price is a digital painting of a character (a table-top RPG original character). Just by doing the raffle I've learnt a few lessons about things I hadn't considered (like asking people not to post porn references... which I hadn't thought was something that could happen). Some other things I've seen, I'm not too sure what should/can I do about it, and I wonder if other people has seen similar stuff and can give me some advice!  


1. I've found out that there's a few accounts that followed me that apparently all they do is participate in art raffles. Lots of them, and nothing else. If I do another raffle in the future, I'll be sure to also warn against 'raffle accounts' that don't support artists in any other way, but my worry is about the fact that these kind of throwaway accounts follow me. Do these kind of accounts usually do scummy stuff like stealing art, or is it safe to let them follow me and just ignore them? Should I block them just in case?  

2. I've found another kind of accounts that worry me more, though, the so-called ""art commissioners"". I was very shocked to discover that one of these accounts makes a living of selling 'characters' through a website called Toyhou. I'm quite lost about this whole 'adopting/selling characters' business and I don't totally get how it works, I wonder if someone around here is familiar with this website. The thing is that these accounts sell characters with art obviously commissioned by many different artists, since the styles don't match at all. So I think these people commission artists to draw their characters, and then make money selling those characters, which includes their art, which would be very very wrong, since no matter if it's their character and their commission, the art's rights belong exclusively to the artist (unless it was otherwise specified in a contract). Does anyone know if this is indeed a typical occurrence?  
I know what I'm talking about exists in a very specific niche, but being an artist focused on character art, I'm kinda worried about these types of accounts in the case someday one of them commission me (since they contact me through email or other platforms, it's difficult to run a background check on them if I can't find them on social media). Should I block these accounts too, to be safe?  


I'm at a point where it's starting to be difficult to check each and every person that follows me, so I'm worried in the future if I keep growing, I couldn't even rely on blocking accounts since some of them could always slip through. Are these just unfounded concerns and I should just chill?

238,ArtistLounge,13c1dyk,how often do you do reference studies/hone your visual library?,"Throughout my art journey I couldn't help but feel like a ""slave to reference"" as some people described it. I always needed reference, but eventually realized I was even using it wrong because I didn't take time to study the reference as it was rather than juxtaposing whatever subject I wanted to draw onto the reference and struggling, such as getting a picture of a person and a character I wanted to draw and struggling to mash the features together because say the character has a hooked nose but the reference doesn't and I don't know how to draw a hooked nose from that angle. 

I started doing reference studies beforehand before starting to draw from imagination, trying to write down what kind of references I'll need for the scene (man playing guitar, man playing guitar in the dark, front view, front view close up)  it's often a hassle trying to find the right reference, but i personally feel annoyed that for example, if I can only find a picture of a man playing guitar at 3/4 view but I'm drawing from front view I will struggle for an hour or more just drawing the hands from a different view and still not feel satisfied because i don't really know how the hands should look, only that they look wrong.


I tried looking into things such as iterative drawing theory videos, but still didn't feel confident. If i don't know how to draw a head from top down view i eventually just got frustrated after a few tries, thinking I was just developing bad habits and needed to look at reference.
It was a struggle to verbalize what looked wrong without remembering what the right thing looks like. Sometimes even subjects I drawn a lot such as some 3/4 face if I don't do a reference study for a while my drawings start to ""distort"" as i mess up features not remembering what they look like exactly. 


As i try to get better I've just started to feel as though I'm very needy when it comes to reference and improving my visual library, but I also don't really know other artists and how they operate. I want to do sequential art (comics and animation) 
And I'm often completely stunned with the scenes some people can draw/animate, I've barely even gotten to a decent place in freehand environment drawing since it feels like Im always revising some reference image just for drawing people. 


I feel like maybe as I move forward i realize I may have underestimated the complexity of certain subjects such as the human body or even a house and you may always need to keep studying and studying even if you've drawn the subject a dozen times, but I still get frustrated sometimes when I think I'm capable of drawing a scene such as someone entering a kitchen and find even stick figures would look better than my figure and the kitchen environment proportions.. knife holders accidentally smaller than hands, cupboards bigger than fridges, at least double the time is just erasing and redrawing proportions then redrawing the likeness, and it still looks off. 
I can draw a house 10 times and the next day  just draw a box and a triangle from imagination. It makes me feel like im sisyphus or something.

I've searched on Chat GPT on how can an artist that people consider good, amazing, GOAT, Legend etc. doesn't let external receptive opinion (via social media, reaction channels, critic websites  etc) get to their head , making them complacent and comfortable in their public status. And one of the answers I got was this:

""Remember that your legacy is not defined by what others think of you but by the impact you make through your art. Stay true to your vision and continue to create meaningful work that resonates with you.""

I've been trying to understand what this really means because I feel like In order to make a good enough impact, people have to generally like you overall. For example, yes there are some people who don't like Drake. But enough people like him (especially in the millions) in order for him to be the top artist that he is today. 

I get the ""create meaningful work that resonates with you"" part. Because you're gonna end up becoming a slave to your own creative process if you make something for others all the time, especially when people bitch and moan about anything no matter what.

240,ArtistLounge,13d0wjp,I hate self doubt and wish I could get over it,"For some reason, I have this horrible pattern where it's like I can draw better or worse in a particular style probably because I'm lacking something that applies to that result. I’ve heard results shouldn't be a concern, so I'm trying to shift my mindset to “doing things right or accurately can't be done until you do it wrong”. I used to want to draw like my favorite artist, but what did I know about perspective and color at 11 when all I did was want to draw fking anime characters? I had no other goals than to draw what I saw but not learn anything. I used to like that my friend could shade better than me, but I never did study shading; I only drew and studied from life but never saw much improvement and would try so hard to make it accurate. Also because I still don't know how drawing from life benefits either other than helping observation, which is hard to understand to form, and trying to copy art that already understands these things so shows my lack of fundamentals



What I'm afraid of if I do end up getting my stuff together and sitting down to learn and why learning is hard in the first place(I overthink a lot 🥲)-
 
Sometimes I do fear not being able to do anything with my fundamentals once I learn them better. Or that “man, I won't improve my portraits at all. What the heck?” To focus on one thing and move on is just difficult. Like when can I move on? What if I watch and study and it's just a waste of time? But most likely it will click because even a little bit will allow it to make sense. Especially with studying included. Like I really wanna improve but I wanna make sure I do and am doing everything in my favor to ensure it. But that’s probably self-doubt too. 

Also fear taking like 10 years to improve or learn just one thing. I'm aware learning at your own pace is fine but what If I wanna change that? ik others aren’t like me but there are ways that other people process things its just so hard to find a way that allows me to process at that rate as an analytical /tactile learner (worst combination ever in my opinion) which you would think would go through all the basics but I lack a tone of discipline. I'm, not a very visual learner when it comes to art unless I already understand a good bit of what's going on to work out the whole process.

It’s s a struggle watching a video or reading a textbook on art but wanting to just draw the examples at hand that  I'm learning period. But no, I kinda feel like I'm sitting through a lecture. Even if it's something basic. The harder stuff is way more interesting but the basic information is a must and but its boring. However, more complex information is then just difficult and annoying because of my lack of understanding and inability to show it and understanding of the skill. To me, nothing is fun If I can’t do anything with my “skills” or the information I just gathered. And I probably can’t because I just learner it but even as I practice if im still not getting it, it kinda bums me out. 

I tried watching other artists, copier and rewatched tutorials, but words and processes didn’t click before. I had trouble even understanding basic shit and it sounded like it did not correlate even when learning it. would gesture be considered basic? I think they are but no they're quite hard in my case; Why probably I am gonna stop trying to draw complex figures it just makes you suffer in confusion if you don’t know anything. But I don’t wanna be stuck drawing boxes and lines forever because it's boring that's not what I wanna do. I'm not gonna get good at what I want to do if I not learning anything about it. But jumping into the subject isn’t any help. Because it gets so difficult that I end up hating it or thinking im just bad. I tried just learning the fundamentals that apply to the subject matter but doing that then for everything I learn is gonna take forever. 

I heard challenging yourself is good but like hard to take away from it when I can’t self-assess my skills that well. I can try and know to work on things that look wrong like perspective and proportions. But nothing really with technique or process assessment. 

Now I understand a bit of what I learned through a bunch of rewatches n fails. Though I hate how it took me so long to get it through my head(this applies to a good bit of what I learning tbh) It was most likely missing elements to my understanding but sometimes I wonder if it's not.  I wish learning from videos and being self-taught weren’t so complicated. And teachers/classes anything along that out the window im only privileged enough to just watch free videos or find online books. Just wish I could understand everything better to improve because this method is the only thing I got to even understand even a bit every few months.  Ik how most things connect in art but applying them is just awful because I can’t show that knowledge in my art. 

So I watch all these videos and get nothing from them in my art because I can’t process that skill or that it's too far ahead. Because it feels so lecture-like.  (Ex. I tried learning gesture that was difficult and tried learning to draw people in perspective, but I didn’t know anything that came before that so that was just gonna fail. Tried drawing boxes and sucked at drawing those from different perspectives) overall idk how to go about learning from tutorials effectively. Like how do other people just get it thousands of people can understand quickly idc if it's my pace let me be one of those people who can do that. Can’t enjoy a process if it's a struggle to learn to then even get to be able to draw what I want visually.",8,0,0.25,2023-05-09 20:58:11,General Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/13d0wjp/i_hate_self_doubt_and_wish_i_could_get_over_it/,Top_Ask_1938,1052
241,ArtistLounge,137i7el,"What do you do when someone uses your characters to judge and label you, just because you chose to design them a certain way?","When it comes to making art and posting it online, there will inevitably be times where you'll attract people who can't or won't understand what you make. And nowadays, people online tend to use the art that artists make as a quick and easy way to formulate opinions of said artist, and even accuse said artist of horrible things if the art in question is considered ""problematic"".

There are people on this subreddit from all walks of life, so it should be expected that some characters will end up being designed in ways that'll be seen as strange or iffy to those who don't come from the same walk of life as the artists who made them. But I've noticed, on this subreddit, other subreddits, and online in general, that artists are being labelled and judged in a very unfair way for how they design their characters.

It's gotten to the point where artists are either so afraid to post anything online that they outright post nothing, or--what I consider to be even worse--they tweak their designs in a way that they're as inoffensive as possible, so they attract the ire of nobody at all. But the downside of the latter is, while it may work, your characters and art in general will end up so bland and so devoid of true imagination and life that they might as well never have drawn it at all.

So, I'm going to ask you all: When someone sees your characters and chooses to judge and label you for them--either due to their body type, their name, their skin tone; their clothes, etc.--what exactly do you do about it?",12,1,0.6,2023-05-04 14:47:16,General Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/137i7el/what_do_you_do_when_someone_uses_your_characters/,Yookee-Mookee,273
242,ArtistLounge,12w8jms,"I'm a good artist but I suck at drawing, should I stop and focus on something else?","I've been diagnosised with dysgraphia and light dyspraxia ever since I was 7. My writing is nearly unreadable (even more so now since I use a computer to study). Fortunately, I don't have a lot of other motor problems other than anything revolving a pen.

Drawing is not a pleasure to me.

Though the simple idea of drawing is something that has always been attractive to me, the action in itself just hurts my hand, makes me tired and crispates my arm like it was possessed by the devil, every stroke from my pencil feels like I'm clawing at a blackboard.

I've always tried to improve on drawing because while I am elocant and I do love to write (on a computer of course). My favorite ways to portray my ideas is and always has been in a graphical way.

But while I've been studying art for a long time (I've been going to art schools most of my life). I don't even see any slight improvement, in fact I'd say I'm regressing. My lines are shaky, they don't make any sense, my gesture drawings kind of makes me think of william utermohlen's last autoportraits.

Everyone I know, even thoses that don't know how to draw make sketches with better lineart than me. Even my chicken scratches looks wobbly.   


And yet I'm nearly always top of my class when it comes to graphical arts and animation made exclusively on computer. (Not with a tablet). I make good fluid animations, I'm good with photography and compositions, I enjoy the use of colors and I have a good sense of lighting,

I understand perspectives and I enjoy experimenting (ironic for someone with dyspraxia), I make very dynamic and lively poses and I feel at home with 3d modelling. All thoses artistic mediums have their tedium to it but it doesn't really affect me. I feel perfectly content with putting lots of time in my work even when it's not good, I just enjoy the process of creating, whatever it is. EXCEPT DRAWING, It just hurts me and I feel like it isn't worth the trouble to keep on learning especially since I already possess the prerequisites asked from an artist. It just saddens me that I should just be up and running but I just can't draw, whatever I do.

Tl:DR

I have dysgraphia, drawing is literally painful to me but I can create good stuff anywhere else.Should I just cut my losses, give up drawing all together and focus on my other artistic interests or do you think it's still a good idea to practice?

245,ArtistLounge,12g4m9t,Should I take a college art class if I don’t know how to draw?,"I know many people probably have asked this before, but I wanted to relate it to my situation. 

So I am starting college again in the fall and I want to take an Art class. Well, more specifically, I want to learn how to draw. My major has nothing to do with this. I want to learn to draw for my enjoyment.

I don’t know how to draw, like AT ALL. I cannot even do the bare minimum thing you can think off.

The art class I want to take is called “Drawing I”.

This is the class description:
An introductory studio experience designed to explore the fundamentals of drawing and drawing-related media. Emphasis will be placed on drawing from observation focusing on accurately describing form in space.  Concepts covered will include gesture, contour, perspective, and value contrast.


I know I can learn to draw without an Art class, but I feel I would feel more pressured to learn if I was in one. Also, I don’t know nor have the Art supplies necessary to be an artist. I only have lined paper at the moment.

My fear is entering an Art class knowing nothing and everyone else knows how to draw. Only 12 people are able to be accepted into the class too. I feel like I’ll be very embarrassed  and the class would be hard for me because I couldn’t keep up.


With this in mind would it be unwise for me to take a Art class?",19,10,1.0,2023-04-09 04:21:50,Beginner,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/12g4m9t/should_i_take_a_college_art_class_if_i_dont_know/,These_Homework_6483,244
246,ArtistLounge,12uwda4,My struggles as an artist and as a person,"I wanted to take a moment to express some of the challenges that I have been facing in my art journey as a late blooming artist ( started drawing at 16, now I’m 18) As a creator, I have found myself struggling with several obstacles that have made it difficult for me to fully express myself and enjoy the process of creating art.

One of the primary issues that I face is a lack of confidence in my artistic abilities. Despite years of practice and dedication to my craft, I still struggle with feelings of doubt and uncertainty when it comes to my work. It can be incredibly discouraging to pour your heart and soul into a piece, only to feel like it doesn't measure up to your own expectations.

In addition to my lack of confidence, I have also found it difficult to develop my own art style. I feel like I am constantly experimenting and trying new things, but I have yet to find a consistent aesthetic that feels truly representative of me as an artist. This can be frustrating because it feels like I'm always starting from scratch, rather than building upon a solid foundation.

Another issue that I face is a fear of failure and rejection from the art community. It can be scary to put your work out there for others to see, especially when you're not sure how it will be received. This fear can be paralyzing and make it difficult to take risks or push yourself outside of your comfort zone.

On top of all of this, I find myself getting frustrated with my progress and slow learning pace. It can feel like everyone else is improving at a much faster rate than I am, and that I'm falling behind. This can be especially difficult when I see other artists who are creating work that I aspire to, but feel like I'm nowhere near their level.

Of course, this brings me to my biggest challenge: comparing myself to other artists and feeling inferior. Every time I look at someone else's work, I find myself getting mad or frustrated. I see all of these wonderful drawings and paintings, and it upsets me because it's something that I want to create, but can't seem to achieve. This can be especially difficult when it comes to social media, where it can feel like everyone is constantly creating amazing work and receiving recognition for it.

Speaking of recognition, I also struggle with a strong desire for success and recognition in my art career. It can be difficult to stay motivated and continue creating when it feels like no one is paying attention or appreciating your work. I often find myself wondering what I'm doing wrong, or why I'm not getting the same attention as other artists.

Finally, I have difficulty focusing on my own goals and achievements, rather than comparing myself to others. It can be challenging to stay true to my own artistic vision when I'm so focused on what other people are doing. I want to create work that is authentic and meaningful to me, but it can be difficult to do so when I'm constantly distracted by what others are doing.

I want to be clear that I don't think these issues are unique to me - I'm sure that many other artists have faced similar struggles in their own journeys. But it's important to me to be honest about the challenges that I'm facing. I believe that acknowledging these difficulties is the first step towards overcoming them.

One recent example of this challenge for me was when I came across a Twitter thread filled with amazing artwork that made me feel envious and frustrated. I saw people creating work that was so similar to what I aspire to create, but their skill and execution were far beyond anything I've been able to achieve. It left me feeling angry and discouraged, and it was difficult to shake off those feelings. 

Here’s the Twitter thread in question ( NSFW warning) https://twitter.com/ohnojustino/status/1647658739065929730

All of that being said, I want to end on a somewhat positive note. Despite these challenges, I still love creating art. I find joy in the",11,4,0.75,2023-04-22 08:51:17,Mental Health,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/12uwda4/my_struggles_as_an_artist_and_as_a_person/,Aromaster4,693

250,ArtistLounge,13dhcrj,I don't know what to do.,"I've been pretty steady in regards to doing art. I really don't feel like I'm in that much of a position to complain, you know? But I've been in this game for years, and those years of just not making art for myself really wore me down in a lot of ways, both technically and emotionally. 

I've had a lot of major discoveries about myself. New tastes and interestes that boiled to the surface and made me want to paint it. And it felt really good painting them!  I really can't emphasize the importance of being authentic on your work. It really just makes everything work. Especially when you've spent most of your career taking orders from other people and abiding by their visions. 

I thought that when I posted my new work to my moderately large following that it would be loved. Because while numbers aren't important to me, a good response is important. I want to connect with people and be all bubbly about the thing I painted. But when I posted it, basically nothing.

It hurt a lot, but I pushed through thinking that I can just keep painting stuff like this and I'll find an audience eventually. But recently I made a personal painting that even worked within the niche I established. Barely a response either. The final straw was when I did a commission that actually had some personal meaning to me, and the performance of that was also pretty underwhelming (though not as painful because the client was ecstatic about it, that really meant a lot to me). 

I feel rejected, I feel exhausted, I feel like I dont want to be an artist anymore. And I REALLY love making it. But I feel like people see me as a content creator. And I don't want to be one. I want my things to be honest, and my interests change very frequently so having holed myself in a niche so effectively really is hurting me. I feel like I'm stuck between wanting to maintain an audience vs doing my own thing. And the more that time goes on, it feels like both cannot happen.

So after watching tons of youtube tutorials and people talking about their art careers as well as drawing on occasion (start and stopped for years)

I started looking into how to start getting into the professional scene and most of the youtubers I saw said start some form of art profile (IG, artstation, Twitter, ect) even if your don't think you are ready.

So I did just that and now I'm getting commission requests a month into my profile and idk if I'm ready  to take them on.. it honestly makes me a little nervious

Truth be told I know literally nothing about the commission process of an artists and I wasn't really expecting to get requests this fast let alone at all. I fully expected my profile to not get any traction for a long time....

258,ArtistLounge,133phve,Skill and its relationship to online presence,"With the online environment changing rapidly (tiktok, reels, shorts, changes in twitter and DA, etc.), you can say the methods that people use to grow their art following have also changed quite dramatically.

A lot of artists that I have seen in the past (2016 era) pretty much built their following off pure skill and didn't really market themselves at all. Not much clickbait and no short-form videos. Sometimes some fanart to help themselves out but not much use of hashtags beyond 3-4.

I was quite curious as to how quickly you might think someone would take grow on IG if they were to start their account over in 2023, with their present level of drawing skill intact. Example, someone at the skill level of WLOP. If they only posted pictures/albums and no reels, how fast do you think they would grow from 0 followers to 10k?

I am been thinking lately that I need to focus more on actual improvement. I can see a lot of gaps in what I do. I think if I work on the gaps first then the rest (maybe) will follow?

[This is my account](https://www.instagram.com/myhlo1344/), fairly new (only a few months), I think maybe just focus on improving my skill and ignore trends for the time being?

259,ArtistLounge,12sfay6,"I feel I will never be able to make the ""leap"" to truly teach myself art fundamentals--lack of time/drive/confidence/energy.","Hi everyone. I apologize in advance for the length of this post. It's hard for me to condense my thoughts and feelings about this topic. 

For a little bit of background, I'm a 20 year old self-taught artist. I mostly draw my own characters and am interested in a semi-realism art style. I don't necessarily think my art is bad, but I have a *very* bad habit of comparing myself to other artists, and I get very envious of artists who are around my age that draw much better than I do. Seeing these artists and their magnificent works makes me feel like shit that I have not been able to progress like them.

I have tried my best to try and not do this, but it can be very difficult sometimes. I want to get better at my art, so I can know that I *can* improve and be proud of my art. I want to do this by learning art fundamentals. I am entirely self-taught, and this teaching is mostly just from references online and lots of practice, without much studying. I have never actually learned art fundamentals (besides from the basic ""ok we are going to shade a circle so it looks like a ball"" activity in art class), and I know that if I can manage to grasp an understanding of fundamentals, my art will improve drastically.

Here's the problem though: I can never actually commit to learning fundamentals... At least, teaching myself. I've tried Drawabox but found that 250 box challenge to just be such a dread that it is hard to force my way through it. I have tried art books, but struggle to actually sit down and consistently practice what I read for several months. I KNOW I need to learn these fundamentals, but I don't know how to just get myself to do it. Even if I was to sit down and study it, I feel like I would just end up copying the references and not actually being able to truly understand what I'm looking at and the ""why"" behind it. In metaphor sense: I can get on the horse, but then I fall off, and it is very very difficult to get back on and actually start trotting. 

I think a part of this is just feeling so exhausted at the end of a day, I don't want to do anything but shut down. My life has been really hectic the past year or so with some serious family stuff, adjusting to adulthood, going through a friend-group breakup, etc. Work is starting to get busy again and I'll be working quite a bit in the summer. By the time I get home, I'm so tired that I can't do anything except lay there for hours til I decide to go to bed. I want to draw, but I just don't have the energy for it. I know that motivation is more than just ""waiting for that moment to strike"". It takes discipline and determination... But I can't actually find the discipline and determination to do this. People say ""if you want it bad enough, you'll do it,"" but I don't know if that's entirely true. Life is so busy that it's hard to fit in the personal stuff you want to improve in. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is: Have you ever been here before? What did you do to try and get over this? 

I want to find art teachers in my area who might be able to point me in the right direction and give me guidance, but it's difficult to find people. Besides from finding professionals who can guide me, what can I do to help myself get into:

1. Drawing consistently
2. Finding the energy to do it when I'm exhausted
And 3. Keeping the drive going  and understanding what I'm studying

 I'm sorry that this post is long and maybe a little incoherent. I'm just very lost and don't know where else to turn for advice. I don't know if I'll ever be able to truly seriously/consistently study fundamentals at this rate. I figured maybe some fellow artists could give me some pointers and anecdotes.

These artists put in thought into colors and composition too, just not in the same way most other more traditional painters would. These painters really help me try to experiment, try new things, expand the boundaries of Art, and form my own styles and just be expressive and ""artsy""

These new mediums and artists are how we progress the art movement into whole new dimensions and levels. Sometimes it fails, but often times it is how we reach new heights and achievements as a whole art community. 

Art is about having fun, being expressive, doing what your heart desires, etc. When we start to gatekeep ""art"" in forms that HAS to resemble realistic objects and technicality, we start to lose valuable artists and new creative minds. 

And yes technical drawings and realism has it's place too! I love them equally. I am not trying to undermine any art students and artists working hard hours on end on a project. 

As for more money laundering side of art such as banana taped to a wall, it's ridiculous and undermine and makes mockery of the beauty of modern art and more unorthodox mediums of art.

263,ArtistLounge,12r85s2,Advice on reporting someone for mass copying artwork.,"Hi fellow artists, first time here so hoping I'm posting this right. I'm hoping to get a little advice on how to proceed with a report for what is essentially art theft. Hoping someone here may have some experience on the subject?  
So I'm dealing with someone who is mass copying my artwork on twitter (probably 40+ now). They straight up redraw my artwork (sometimes changing a character but it is directly copying my compositions). They did not ask for permission ever and have not left credit or linked back to me once. They are word for word copying my tweet descriptions as well.

I dmed them politely asking them to stop. They ignored me, so I asked them to stop on one of their copied tweets, they ignored me. I blocked them. No more copied tweets for a couple weeks, all good. Today, I check the keywords again, and they are now using a different account and continuing with the theft (and mass posted like ten copied drawings within two days :/). 

I'm trying to figure out what the best method is to report them but the twitter report system seems rather convoluted and not directly related to my problem (block evasion and art/content theft, or generally asking for these tweets to be taken down), and there doesn't seem to be any way to leave any comments describing the situation. 

What would be the best method for reporting this?

TL;DR Someone on twitter is mass redrawing my artwork without permission even after I asked them to stop and blocking them. I am looking for help on how to proceed with reporting them.",11,15,0.89,2023-04-19 02:10:54,General Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/12r85s2/advice_on_reporting_someone_for_mass_copying/,Alukeart,272
264,ArtistLounge,12lvx1f,Switching to hiring artists for my work instead of solo,"I bought my iPad roughly 5 years ago. While I've enjoyed the time I've spent creating art, I'm so far off from where I want to be. 

1) I take medicine that gives me tremors in my hands, so my grip isn't steady. 

2) Massive daydreaming. I think this is an advantage for coming up with ideas and concepts. I have a couple that I think about creating for months but haven't even started LOL.

3) Simply not putting in the hours. Like I'm 5 years in and my next project is watch a youtube video or two on drawing ears. I'm literally at the point where a serious artist would have been 3 month in their journey. I'm sure there are middle schoolers with better art than me. To tell you the truth, I guess I don't enjoy drawing that much. Steven King said you need to spend 4-6 hours on something that you're so good at and enjoy it so much. Pretty sure this isn't m,e. 

4) I consider myself a savvy person. I've had some entrepreneurial success in business so while learning and mastering artistic techniques definitely isn't my strength, hopefully promotion, finding talent, etc. will be. 

Now that I type this out, I'm convinced this is the course of action I'm going to take. I want to be respectful of artist work, not be some crazy greedy business guy etc. 

Do I call it an ""artist collective""?

Tips/advice?

266,ArtistLounge,12pv6wk,I can study art but can't do personal art anymore. What happened?,"So I started trying to take art more seriously last year by implementing a lot of studying into my routine. Master copies, the fundamentals, going through books I like and replicating them from imagination after I do studies of them, etc. I think it resulted in a lot of progress and improvement.

However, as of the last couple of months. I just...can't do art anymore. It's not necessarily art block because I can do art and I do art for multiple hours per day actually. But 95% of it is just either reference studies, master studies, or fundamentals. I know I can still do fun personal art (I think?) because I just was doing that a couple of months ago, but it feels literally impossible now. I get up to the page, and I draw blanks. I have references for ideas I have in my head and still draw blanks. I even took a break from doing art entirely for 2/3 days and that helped a little bit, but no cigar, back to the same problem.

So what gives? Did I overstudy myself into becoming an art machine instead of an artist now? I legit can't comprehend how to get out of this and its such an odd problem to have, so its hard to talk about with others.

270,ArtistLounge,12sog8x,Do you have to be a master realist painter to get a job at all in art?,"Hi guys :)

&#x200B;

I have been frustrated with my stagnant art progress for the past five months... the main issue is that I am not getting better at painting realism. My goal basically is to get as good as the artists working for e.g. MtG some day.

The thing is, I have been so focused on practise and getting better during this period that I got pretty detached from the fun of doing art. It has mostly to do with the ""Why am I not getting better at values/construction/etc. even though I practise it?Can I even make it at all or am I just not meant to be an artist??""-mindset. I even had someone help me out during the past weeks and showing me my weaknesses all of the time (there are many). But I am still plateauing.

Now, I am at the point where I wonder if it's worth trying so hard to improve or if I should just accept my current level and go with it. Like, maybe I will improve during the next five years, maybe not, I'm currently just sick  and burnt out of the grind. I want to enjoy art again more than I am disappointed with my current skill level.

I want to work as a professional digital artist, so I have been putting in at least 4-5 hours per day for the past five years (due to some health constraints I can't do more) and know my weaknesses, I am just not getting better at them as fast as I'd like to. 

So, I wanted to know, if you don't pursue working in a company like Riot, Wizards or the like, do you even have to be so masterly? Would a ""lesser"" art skill level make it possible to start out/work in the field, too, e.g. as a freelance artis or in an indie studio?

271,ArtistLounge,12ogycj,How should I approach this digital commission?,"I got a DM on ig for someone wanting a commission done. It’s a digital drawing of their cat. So I have a few questions about how I should approach this. First I’m wondering is there a way this could be a scam? I’m not naive to the fact that there are A LOT of scams aimed at artists. So how do I tell if it is a scam and what would be the scam so I know how to avoid it? Second thing I’m wondering is how do I make the transaction? I need to make sure it feels safe for both me and the client, i.e I want to get payed first before I give them the drawing but I’m sure the client would be worried about giving me their money without a finished drawing. Lastly wondering what I should price it? The client (kindly) offered $100 without any previous discussion of price, I was thinking $120. However it has been taking longer than I’d hoped for me to complete the drawing. So is that a fair price for us both?

All advice is appreciated, thanks for reading & apologies this was really long just wanted to make sure I made the situation clear.

Edit: also forgot to add I’m wondering how I get the art piece to them, like what file type and all that?

At this point I can't tell anymore what I want my artstyle to be. I don't know if I want it to be similar to Yusuke Murata or Dan Mora, or more stylized like Yukinobu Tatsu, or Yoshifumi Totsuka.

But there's also artists on Instagram who's artstyles are perfect to me and I want my artstyle to be like theirs.

Like flancortes, Thatboy_studio, Willytron2000, Yotaku_boi, Viniciuslopez_artwork 

I love their artstyles and I'd love for mine to be just like theirs.

There's so many different types of media, shows, Manga, comics, movies, etc that have different artstyles that I want mines to be like but it's just too many that at this point I have no idea what I want it to be like. And honestly, with whatever I have as my artstyle now, if I can even call it that, I'm not satisfied with it. I have no clue how to improve it or anything. 


As for me not improving, I try to draw consistently. But somedays I don't feel like it. I have ADHD. I still can barely draw someone in a neutral pose, at least without the hips and legs looking messed up. I still can't draw dynamic poses, I never learned color and don't know where to learn. I still don't even know how to draw female bodies, no clue how to shade etc. I get very frustrated since I try to watch art tutorials about it, but my brain can barely ever grasp and hold onto what the person's saying. And at the end of the video, if I can even watch it for that long, I hardly even remember what they were saying to begin with. 

Anatomy, dynamic poses, shading, color, how to focus better, how to plan, how to study, find your artstyle, the fundamentals etc. It's like my brain just tosses out the information that I desperately need.

I'm basically just binge watching art tutorials hoping that it can help me. I'm just so frustrated since I don't even know if I have an artstyle and I don't know what to improve or learn better.

277,ArtistLounge,130f31p,How to preserve dried plants to use in artwork?,"I'm a paper artist so I know a little bit about using archival supplies in my work.  I'm also into crafting and creating miniature diorama type artwork, so I would also like to prolong the life of the hard work I do.  I've been collecting various plants from around my home like moss, lichens, branches and twigs and tiny flowers and leaves.  I know some of them will fade in sunlight, but what else can happen?  I'm new to this so I haven't kept these types of dried plants for very long, I've had them for about a year now and I'm keeping them in boxes and wrapped in archival papers.  The only dried plants I've had for long periods are rose bouquets that I dried upside down.  Is there some secret to preserving plants?  It's difficult to find things in google because the results all seems very basic (as google always is these days), for quick crafts and decorations, nothing really serious or about fine art.  I'm not that great at googling anymore for some reason since they changed their algorithm years ago.  

Anyway, from what I've found, apparently if you don't treat dried plants, they will fade and disintegrate...I definitely don't want them to fade and turn to dust, as I'm all about using lightfast pigments and acid free materials in my artwork.  My idea was to spray them with an acrylic sealant, or brush a matte medium on things that can be brushed.  I did buy this spray mod podge that is UV resistant but not sure if it's non-yellowing, I also have the acrylic version that has bad fumes.  And I have matte gel medium.  I will probably also add lightfast colors to the plants with watercolors to aid with fading.  I've read about using glycerin and water and soaking them in there and then drying it, but I'm not sure if they need to be fresh first, and I also heard it smells really bad after.

I'm not sure if this is the right sub, I'm having trouble finding the proper sub to ask.  Has anyone worked with dried plants before?

Quick backstory: I’ve never considered myself an “artist”. I’ve always been a creative person by nature and dabbled in almost every other creative outlet. Art museums and history were enjoyable but creating art itself never stuck despite currently being a graphic designer by trade. I sucked at it and never had the drive to learn the required skill. 6 or 7 years ago I learned a LOT about art and digital drawing and fell in love. I even got a Wacom tablet! (Thanks Draw With Jazza). Since then I’ve had an on again-off again relationship with art. I bought an iPad in 2019 and have made so much on it, even a thing or two that I’m proud of.

However, the last 4 months, this barely there hobby turned into full blown passion. I was creating non stop, taking art classes and even trying out the art that intimidated me the most: traditional art (no undo button there!) It was great. I felt so happy that I finally clicked with art, I was happy to finally call myself an artist and even made work that wasn’t complete garbage! 

Things took a turn in the last few weeks. I don’t know if I’m experiencing burnout, a depressive episode or a combination of the two, but I feel no drive to create anymore. I don’t hate it, I don’t love it, I’m just indifferent. That feeling scares me. I’m scared I lost my passion or even worse that this was just an ADHD hyperfixation phase. I’ve had those throughout my life which is why I was so happy to finally have the “label” of artist, to have something that finally stuck.

Anyway, any advice here guys? I don’t want to lose my passion for this.

And its already painful as hell to draw on my ipad with ibis paint x, Having me to redo the lines everytime for not looking so proper, I'm having my drawing tablet be shipped around april 20 (Around i'm not sure) And ever since then, I have been constantly training on drawabox, And drawing lessons from the famous artists school.  


Yet I'm feeling tired, I'm feeling empty, I'm feeling like I'm not progressing much, Yet I wish I had time and the energy to draw more, But maybe I am, The famous artists school kind of threw me into another whole perspective on anatomy, Drawing bodies and torsos as cylinders instead, And drawing most of the bodies like arms and legs in cylinders, And the joints in the middle as spheres. But I'm not sure. Hell I tried redrawing an old drawing that looked good, And the newer one ended up being terrible. Tho I tried drawing something realistic, And I guess I can say the anatomy looked good on most of the part.   


Yeah I have been drawing from life alot, Even with drawabox too having reached the drawing animals lesson. I get this energy that I feel empty, I don't see much progress, I feel like I'm stuck, I'm too not confident in getting back to drawing things that I want to draw till I feel like my part has improved, And has it? Well it depends, That picture of the guy I drew did end up I guess anatomically decent, Pretty sure Famous artists school helped me out on face detailing alot with my pencil. And drawing the heads too.  


But honestly, On the other on drawing things in a more cartooney manner, I feel like, I fell in a downgrade. I don't know why, The latest drawing of mine in a cartoony art style with from what I have learned, Feels Fine I guess, A bit of a problem with the head being round thats all, Honestly I don't know where to work on that.

They do not nail anatomy right in the first try. They have to flip image to see the error. Some artists with minimal style art has very rough sketch behind. They have to sketch multiple times before final line art. They work slow and steady. Their works do not magically appear like when we see it in speedpaint. 

Basically, on top of learning about their technique, I also learn that it is not impossible to draw that good when I watch they work on their arts.",3,23,0.96,2023-04-24 16:59:41,Digital Art,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/12xgqr2/just_want_to_say_that_real_time_live_drawing_of/,LunalienRay,103

I know there's **Pureref** for viewing photos, but this is more of a project-to-project basis. There's its' cousin **BeeRef**, which is similar and allows for text to be added, but this is also more for a project-to-project basis. I've tried using it for larger collections and it becomes so slow.

There's **RefShelf**, which is great for organizing images, but doesn't allow me to add notes or additional text.

**Allusion** seems to be a similar organization program to RefShelf and allows for tagging, but I still would like to add notes. 

**Freeplane** seems to be a very advanced version of what I'm looking for in terms of capabilities but I'm not sure if it would be the correct fit for art/photos/references.

I left my habit of drawing and doodling then(I did draw a little bit then my habit gradually vanished out of my routine). I finished my Masters Degree in 2020 and then got a job which I'm still doing. That makes it about 5 approx years of me without touching my drawing tools. Thankfully I got good grades and won several prizes from my university but at the sacrifice of my habit that I loved dearly.

314,ArtistLounge,12nggrd,"For 3 years, I tried and failed to attend art school 7 times, before I finally graduated from my dream art school (TW: mentions of illness)","This is (part of) my story. 

I have always wanted to go to art school and be an artist. But when I was 14, I was diagnosed with a chronic illness. I also have anxiety, depression, trauma, and severe sensitivities. For 3 years, I tried and failed to attend college over 7 times.

The first time, my college program was suddenly discontinued and I had a week notice to move out. I started necessary medical treatment (hell) for my chronic illness.

The second time, I was unable to continue the same program at another college, because it was too expensive and I didn’t know how long I would be in medical treatment.

The third time, I was too sick to go to my home state university and I needed months more of medical treatment. I stopped wanting to go to school, and I just wanted to go home.

The fourth time, after I moved home, I realized I couldn't live in my hometown or attend state university because the pollution made my health worse again. I moved out of state.

The fifth time, I couldn't afford the out-of-state tuition, so I had to go to community college first.

The sixth time, the community college building was full of toxins, and I was still extremely sick. I chose to return to medical treatment for months.

The seventh time, I finished medical treatment, and I finally found my dream art school with my dream program, illustration and comics!

I finally graduated art school (after an extra year, severely burnt out, with hand pain). 

I couldn’t find a job for 6 months (because of my health and limited job experience) (until I had less than $50 and went into debt), but I finally found a part-time job as an art teacher!

My dream is to be an artist and content creator. I create fan art, mental health comics, and a webcomic about space pirates (in development). Here is my art if you want to support me! [https://linktr.ee/lil\_ghostnebula](https://linktr.ee/lil_ghostnebula)

I still haven’t given up on my dream, despite feeling so worn down by obstacle after obstacle, failure after failure. I am still afraid that everything will go wrong. I am afraid of failure, afraid of success, afraid of rejection. I have imposter syndrome, self-doubt, and self-sabotaging behaviors. I am even afraid to share this.

I want others, especially artists, to know that they are not alone. I know there are others with similar experiences. You are not alone. 

Keep going. You never really fail unless you give up when you want to keep going. It’s okay to give up if you no longer want a goal. Sometimes you realize that you no longer want a goal, or the hardship it takes to reach that goal is not worth it to you, or you develop a new goal, and that is perfectly ok.

315,ArtistLounge,1383ay0,My problem is that I am too impressionnable,"Hello everyone,
I ""seriously"" started photography last year. 
I mostly make architecture, city and night photography with a kind of dystopian style because I am heavy influenced by cyberpunk culture, sci Fi stuff. In arts, it is really my favorite thing. But I have a real problem, I get ""bored"" fast, and sci Fi is not the only thing I like.

I am too impressionnable, I hope it's the correct English word ahah, but what I mean is that for example, I have watched the movie ""mommy"" today, and I was stunned by the photography and now I want to get into this golden, nostalgic and warm style.
Tomorrow I will listen a band, feel all kind of emotions that I will want to translate in my photography but it will be something that has nothing to do with the rest of my photos. 

Today my Instagram feed is a mess because I often change style.
There is so much to do in photography and in arts in general that I just want to do anything. But I don't think it is ""sain"" for an artist to get lost in all kind of style

How will people remember my photos ? Did you ever struggle with a photo, a drawing, piece of music that you loved doing but you didn't published it because it is too much out of place in comparison of your other work ?

It seems like I can kinda get the gist of how colours work, but struggle with most things in any way relates to forms.

I also understand some basic anatomy, but mostly because of my background in martial arts. Yet I struggle to put my thoughts into art.

During the last few days I tried to improve my face drawing skills, I asked on this subreddit a few times and got very good tips that already helped me understand a bit more. Yet it I still struggle and I will most likely struggle for the next week's until I can draw something as simple as a good pair of eyes.

During that time I also realised that there are some artists that can easily whip out a nice looking jaw, or eyes, or noses. Others draw a basic face that doesn't looks bad, but compared to the legs or hands? Different levels. That made me think *what did others struggle with, how long did it take them?*

So I would like to ask, what did you guys struggle with that others seem to master easily? What's something basic that you didn't understand for a long time?

320,ArtistLounge,12t12p9,Tips on finding a style / Get out of an art crisis?,"I think I hit the lowest point of my current digital art related life.

Been drawing for roughly 2 and a half years again after being on a break for a long time, and its nice, I am happy. But I am working on some projects and apparently, I am incapable of finding a style I can accurately say is mine.

Now I don't hate what I produce. I rather like it. My problem is I lack consistency in personal pieces, I switch styles frequently to test out new brushes, different shading, sometimes lineless, sometimes painting, sometimes smth else.

And individually, that is fine, that's a good thing I think personally to try out different tools and programs and so on to see what fits. However, I am currently helping on a big project, basically a comic in its planning stages, meaning at the very least, the first few pages should look roughly the same style wise. Yes the art style will evolve with time most likely unless one actively goes out of my way to repeat it as is, but during this project, my view of my art kind of got shattered.

I've been told my artwork is recognizable because of my choice of colors, patterns and details in designs. Said colors and details however need to be toned down for the project, and suddenly, I am left with art which does not feel like me, it does not spark me any joy.

It looks fine, it looks good enough to be praised and pass as a potential style for the comic since for now only test pages have been done. But while it may work for the project I am now questioning my entire identity and what I've been doing because I have tried so many things. Both trying to reference/copy artists I follow to just, close my eyes and see what happens, and I don't see an identity. What does it say if smth as simple as colors and details ""destroy"" the art style when being simplified or adjusted for tonal setting? What does that say for bigger personal projects I might want to attempt one day which would likely need to be adjusted to fit the medium?

Does someone have a tip on what to do? What to try to potentially find at least the start of what could be ""your"" art style? I am just frustrated with myself right now, tbh, and it would be nice to hear other people's opinions.",3,3,0.71,2023-04-20 17:39:20,General Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/12t12p9/tips_on_finding_a_style_get_out_of_an_art_crisis/,GenoGlitch_01,410

So for about maybe for a while now and on occasion, I have always enjoyed making art of characters that often come from stories that I create or just love to draw. And honestly as well, I’m truly not the best artist like most people I see online, and I know I can’t judge my own style to someone else’s. But, the one thing that I struggle with the most is just getting general poses down. Usually when I need to just use one for a piece, I admittedly have no choice but to trace over the image and then add my own details onto it like hair, makeup, eyes, etc. And a part of me feels bad about it because I feel like just in general I can’t become a great artist because of how I often depend on tracing to save me. 

Truthfully I want to improve and be better. So, I want to ask if anyone has any advice on how I can improve my ability to draw or reference poses?

I have a bachelor’s from Parsons (2015) and a masters from Royal College of Art (2018). I studied photography both times but in my mfa I really let go of the rigidity instilled at Parsons and realized I’m more of a painter than I thought and being that it was RCA I was able to experiment. However, it’s been post-graduating that I’ve really leaned into this.

Like I said, I graduated in 2018 so it’s been awhile since I’ve been in the art setting and as an adult, with a more serious defined style, I would really like to expand upon this with tutors and peers.

This article sheds light on the challenges of creating predictable AI art, which is a topic not often discussed. Many people assume that creating AI art requires little to no skill, but when it comes to specific results, it can be quite a time-consuming and intricate process.

For instance, if you want to create a particular image, such as a portrait of a friend dressed as the Bride of Frankenstein, holding a cat, in a lab filled with old electronics, you can't just input a prompt and expect the AI to deliver the desired result. It may require a considerable amount of time and expertise to edit prompts and switch between different models to achieve the intended outcome.

While this may not matter to the casual user, it's a crucial skill set for contract artists who need to produce specific AI art for clients.

 ""If a work's traditional elements of authorship were produced by a machine, the work lacks human authorship and the Office will not register it.\[26\]   For example, when an AI technology receives solely a prompt \[27\]   from a human and produces complex written, visual, or musical works in response, the “traditional elements of authorship” are determined and executed by the technology—not the human user. Based on the Office's understanding of the generative AI technologies currently available, users do not exercise ultimate creative control over how such systems interpret prompts and generate material. Instead, these prompts function more like instructions to a commissioned artist—they identify what the prompter wishes to have depicted, but the machine determines how those instructions are implemented in its output.\[28\]   For example, if a user instructs a text-generating technology to “write a poem about copyright law in the style of William Shakespeare,” she can expect the system to generate text that is recognizable as a poem, mentions copyright, and resembles Shakespeare's style.\[29\]   But the technology will decide the rhyming pattern, the words in each line, and the structure of the text.\[30\]   When an AI technology determines the expressive elements of its output, the generated material is not the product of human authorship.\[31\]   As a result, that material is not protected by copyright and must be disclaimed in a registration application.""

406,aiArt,13c0kdn,Sharing my experience for Imagine Art Generator,"As an artist, I've always relied on traditional techniques to create my pieces. From oil painting to sketching, I found solace in the process of bringing my ideas to life. However, with the rapid advancements in technology, I felt the need to adapt and explore new avenues for my creative expression. Midjourney was the start where I and think all of us started. 4 months back I stumbled at a simple app : Imagine ( [https://imagine.art](https://imagine.art) ) ( ps. Imagine web is totally free in its betas, thank me later ), which is one of its kind of the app.  


After using it for months I wanted to give a honest review about it to everyone. It definitely is one of the most amazing products in this domain. The most exciting is that competes with Midjourney with a very unique model named as **Imagine V4.** On the other hand it has a mix of really really good models for portraits and anime's. I would say prior 4 months it had such of being fun using it and generating really beautiful arts with it.   


Considering this is the only product which is on Android/iOS/Web gives me a lot of flexibility of using from any where. I would definitely recommend everyone of you to give it a try and believe me you won't every open Midjourney's Discord ( so difficult ) again.  


Here is some of my cute generations with it

414,aiArt,12u17os,The Impact of AI Art on the World: A Catalyst for Creativity?,"Hi Reddit, I've been pondering the implications of AI-generated art and how it might be affecting the art world. While many people have expressed concern that AI-generated art could negatively impact artists, I believe that there's a different perspective to consider.

AI-generated art is often based on existing patterns, styles, and trends in the art world, which means that it is only capable of producing what has already been created. For example, most major music genres have been impacted by AI-generated content due to the abundance of similar music. However, this also means that new styles of music or experimental art will always remain unique and untouched by AI.

In a way, AI can serve as a catalyst for creativity. It can encourage artists to push back against the familiar and venture into the unknown, creating something truly innovative. This creative drive is something that has been dampened over time as artists often feel pressured to imitate popular trends.

As an artist who goes by the name ""Ancient Prayers,"" I can personally attest to the importance of creating unique, original works that don't even resemble my previous creations. Even if an AI were fed my entire body of work and trained to replicate it, it would never be able to predict my next piece, as each of my creations is distinct and offers a new experience.

In essence, AI-generated art can teach us a valuable lesson: to break free from the confines of established rules and create something truly groundbreaking. Art has always been about pushing boundaries and challenging norms, and AI can serve as a reminder to reclaim that spirit of innovation. If AI can imitate a certain style or genre, it's an indication that there is already enough material for it to learn from, which could mean that it's no longer truly creative.

Personally, I'm not afraid of AI-generated art because I know that my own creativity will always set me apart. What are your thoughts on this subject? Do you see AI as a threat to the art world or as an opportunity for growth and innovation?

419,aiArt,12wyhzr,Brief History of AI Drawing/Digital Art (Part 1),"The use of AI for ""art"" fired up back in the early days of computer graphics and the invention of the computer.

""In the 1950s and 1960s,  computer graphics generated simple patterns and shapes."" With the lack of development technology, AIs could only use simple algorithms to create patterns.

By the 1970s and 1980s, AI-generated art became more popular (development of CAD/Computer-aided art). CAD could generate and manipulate 3Dimensional shapes on the screen and based on this artist Harold Cohen developed a set of algorithms, collectively known as AARON.

By the 1980s and 1990s, AARON was able to create abstract paintings including drawings of rocks, plants, and humans.

420,aiArt,12jx2ve,"masterpiece, highly detailed Makoto Shinkai animation style","&#x200B;

Once upon a time, there was a boy named Alex who had long, flowing hair. He loved spending his afternoons in the forest, surrounded by the tranquility of nature.

One day, as he was sitting on a log and enjoying the peaceful sounds of the woods, he noticed a small bird sitting on a nearby branch, chirping merrily. Intrigued, he walked over to the bird and noticed that it was injured.

Without hesitation, Alex picked up the bird and held it gently in his hands. He noticed that the bird's wing was broken, and it wouldn't be able to fly. Alex knew he had to help the bird, so he brought it back to his home and nursed it back to health.

For days, Alex took care of the bird, feeding it and making sure it had a comfortable place to rest. When the bird was finally healed, Alex released it back into the forest, watching as it flew away, chirping happily.

From that day forward, Alex continued to explore the forest, finding new ways to connect with nature and all the creatures that called it home. He realized that sometimes the most fulfilling moments in life can be found in the simplest acts of kindness, and that the beauty of the world can be found in the tiniest of details.

429,aiArt,12xf5ke,is AI at odds with creativity? how can we harness it without limiting ourselves?,"One important point to note is that AI is designed to find patterns and predict outcomes based on data. While this is incredibly useful for tasks like image recognition or language translation, it falls short when it comes to creative tasks. Creative tasks require originality, intuition, and human emotion - things that AI simply cannot replicate. For example, a designer may use their intuition and personal experience to come up with a unique design solution that may not fit within any existing pattern or data set. Similarly, a writer may use their imagination and empathy to create a story or character that resonates with readers on a personal level. These kinds of creative solutions are unlikely to be generated by AI.

However, many companies are turning to AI for creative tasks in the belief that it will save time and money. This may be true in some cases, but it also comes with risks. By relying too heavily on AI, companies risk creating a world where all creative output is the result of algorithms and data, rather than human inspiration and innovation. This could lead to a lack of diversity and originality in creative output, and could even lead to a world where human creativity is no longer valued.

As designers and creatives, we need to be aware of this trend and fight against it. We must embrace the qualities that make us human - our imagination, empathy, and ability to think outside the box - and use them to create things that are truly unique and meaningful. This means staying curious, exploring new ideas, and being open to experimentation. It also means being willing to take risks and challenge the status quo, rather than relying on what has worked in the past.

In conclusion, while AI has its benefits, we must be careful not to let it stifle our creativity. We must continue to nurture our artistic skills and use them to create works of art that are truly original and inspiring. By doing so, we can ensure that human creativity remains a valuable and essential part of our society, even as technology continues to advance.",1,0,0.4,2023-04-24 16:06:22,Discussion :speaking2:,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiArt/comments/12xf5ke/is_ai_at_odds_with_creativity_how_can_we_harness/,Lewenhart87,354

I have been more focused on the artist, creative, and assistance aspects of AI for the disabled community, but I just had a thought after seeing politicians run through AI to become drag queens--could one theoretically use an AI program to churn out so many images or so many pages of data and correctly tag them so that it would homegenize the related algorithmic data?

432,aiArt,12gmx61,Master of AI art programs,"I really like thinking of AI as a tool that already talented people can use to aid their artist process in whatever way they want. That's how all tools work, they make your work faster and higher quality.

But it's really interesting to think about the AI tool in the same sense as other tools that can be mastered. There is a certain level of skill that once surpassed, you begin to create effects from a tool that someone picking it up for the first time may never understand. For example, slap box or tapping techniques on a guitar. Or distinctive characteristic brush strokes, as individual as fingerprints to painters. I'm very curious to see and start to understand the levels of master that goes into using AI tools.

I think we can all see that someone using an AI they are familiar with can create something astonishing and out of the league of someone just starting, and that doesn't just apply to realism or accuracy of prompt to outcome. Master AI artists create a style all their own and can create works that don't have the normal pitfalls of AI.

A stunning rainbow arches across the sky, while the shining sun illuminates the scene with its golden rays. The background is slightly blurred, creating depth and focus on the character, while various lighting effects and textures enhance the overall quality and create a magical and immersive atmosphere. Animal silhouettes can be seen in the background, adding to the natural beauty of the scene and enhancing the sense of tranquility. The image is refined with digital techniques, such as Photoshop and VFX, to create a professional art that captures the beauty and serenity of nature.

446,StableDiffusion,134hbnh,Is an AI-Image-Generation-User a True Artist?,"I often thought, while generating images, if i only would learn to draw properly i could just paint the image I want and wouldnt need to do 100 inpaint jobs or spend so much time with prompt engineering and if i would get good at drawing it would probably take the same amount of time or even less.   
I believe many people want to express themselves creatively and combined with this quick dopamin addicted society ai art comes in handy. If people learn to get away from instant gratification (cheap dopamin), activities that hold long term benefits become attractive again, such as learning to draw. I think ai art can be a good start for people to realize they want to express themselves creatively and i think everyone wants that, its just a question whether they are aware of it or not, but in the long term i think it would be wise to only use ai art as a helping-tool and still develope skills, that are not completely depended on a computer and especially skills that are not reinforcing this insanity of instant gratification behaviour. AI Image Generators can be used as a tool to tap into the creative potential and i think it can be used to learn to draw things and surely if you spend hours inpainting its a creative process but i still believe this shouldnt be the ultimate goal of creative expression and it should merely be a start of creative journey.   
Society is already way too depended on computers and their ""smart""-devices, all of which are reinforcing this unnatural quick dopamin releases, which leads to bad decisions personaly as well as globally. We need to become aware of this and maybe shift from a society that hunts for the next instant dopamin release to one, that actually starts once again to see long term benefits and disadvantages of their actions and that makes more wise choices and that doesnt get lost in their blind strive for more and for ""faster"" things and that uses the ""high"" they get in the now (from instant dopamin) as a justification why this or that is right, while ignoring many of the risk somethings hold. This is exactly what an addict would do and dopamin is strongly connected with addictions, the most addictive substance are all causing dopamin releases and its not a coincidence that the big companies have abused this mechanism of the human body and psyche greatly to bind people to their platform and generate more screentime. The masses have been manipulated into this behaviour and its time to bring more awareness to this issue, because the more you are depended on instant gratification the less you will see the long term risks of activities ( that are causing the release) are holding.  


And this is fundamental thing to consider, because motivation for creating something matters. Is the creation motivated by the hunt for new fast dopamin or maybe something deeper and do you enjoy the creative process and are you actually willing, at least at times, to spend hours on creating something, something that you will actually use and not just look at for 5 seconds, have a laugh and then generate the next 200 images. So when someone spends hours in stable diffusion editing something he can surely be considered an artist, but i would ask everyone to keep in mind this image generation ai's only exist because other people put the time to learn to draw and put hours of effort to create a single image (sure there are also alot of photos :)... Honor the Artists (Painters, Photographers, etc) that (unwillingly) made this entire AI-Thing happen. And if you havent been creative before use this technology to start your creative journey and dont get lost in it.

449,StableDiffusion,12xbvfg,"Too Many People Are Pretending that AI is Just ""Another Tool for Artists""","""Just another tool in the toolbox"", I think people need to stop pushing this because I see it everywhere. Either from artists full on copium, or brand new new AI artists. Is AI just a tool? For NOW, I agree, it is a little limited and people need to put in some work. In the next 2-3 years? I think will greatly exceed what qualifies as a tool for work. It is a system who's end goal is minimizing human input (eventually complete and total automation of image creation, if one so wishes). And that is how it will be used in most cases. 

I am not really against it, hell if I can get my ideas at the click of a button, I welcome it. But I think it's quite disingenuous when people go around calling it just a tool. It is meant to do everything instead of the user, not aid the user (unless the user deliberately chooses to limit themselves in some capacity). Only for now does the user need to hack their way through it. And it will absolutely eliminate any kind of image creating profession, in all but the niche, which is another thing I think people need to stop beating around the bush about. It's going to happen.

Therefore, with all that said, I disagree with calling it simply a tool. Will it be just a ""tool"" if you choose to use it in a more limited capacity instead of letting it do everything? Sure enough, but that is the key difference, it will be a choice, because no other ""tool"" can do 100% of it for you if you let it.",34,0,0.17,2023-04-24 14:06:07,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/12xbvfg/too_many_people_are_pretending_that_ai_is_just/,Feisty-Pay-5361,277
450,StableDiffusion,12zfb1v,Debate: Can AI art exist without artists?,"Sorry to bother you, but I really think we should talk about that fact.

I 've read some of the debate around AI generated images, and it always misses the point where the AI art exists BECAUSE artists did something before. What will it become when there will be no artists? 

Some art students give up on their studies because they feel inferior (in light, body proportions, ideas etc). I wonder if the job will even exist in the future. It takes a whole youth to create your own style, and now we can just type ""in a Moebius style"" in the prompt and voilà. But in the future, AI could generate original styles. So there's no point for an artist to do a job that can be made in 5 min, and better, also there will be no money for him. (And I disagree with the fact that art is the idea, not the rendering, if it was that, philosophers would be considered as artists). 

Some of you say artists react violently to that evolution. Please walk a mile in their shoes. Yes AI is theft, and not just because it steals from individuals, but because it steals from human. AI needs humans. It CAN'T exist without the work of artists. My point is that when artist will no longer exist, we will just depends on the machine and the stock from History.

I specialize in 3d asset clothing creation, ([https://www.daz3d.com/ruris](https://www.daz3d.com/ruris)) ([https://www.renderosity.com/marketplace/vendors/Ruris](https://www.renderosity.com/marketplace/vendors/Ruris)), and currently only experience of SD is just installation of Automatic1111 and playing with some downloaded Checkpoint/LORA. I probably need to know a lot more to get to do what I require, I understand that this may be too long to explain to me, just provide me some keywords to search for is fine.

This is just a high level process in my head:

a) finish creating my asset

b) render in Daz Studio (any directions, as many poses as require, plain background,), and if required, it is possible to generate canvasses (black and white cutout) to help

c) perform training process in SD **(this is the area with zero knowledge)**

d) then the final output is a Checkpoint? a LORA? 

e) finally, use SD, referencing results created earlier, and generate the images. I should get a similar looking girl/hairstyle/clothing. Background, poses, and other small stuff like hair moving more organically, clothing creases, those can be dynamic. Main priority is just the clothing item, the girl face and hair can follow those Checkpoint/LORA, if it make things easier.

I don't have it all figured out yet, but here’s everything I’ve learned so far… [GUIDE]","I wanted to share my process, tips and tricks, and encourage you to do the same so you can develop new ideas and share them with the community as well!

I’ve never been an artistic person, so this technology has been a delight, and unlocked a new ability to create engaging stories I never thought I’d be able to have the pleasure of producing and sharing.

**Here’s a sampler gallery of consistent images of the same character:** [https://imgur.com/a/SpfFJAq](https://imgur.com/a/SpfFJAq)

*Note: I will not post the full story here as it is a steamy romance story and therefore not appropriate for this sub.* **I will keep guide is SFW only - please do so also in the comments and questions and respect the rules of this subreddit.**

# Prerequisites:

* Automatic1111 and baseline comfort with generating images in Stable Diffusion (beginner/advanced beginner)
* Photoshop. No previous experience required! I didn’t have any before starting so you’ll get my total beginner perspective here.
* That’s it! No other fancy tools.

**The guide:**

This guide includes full workflows for creating a character, generating images, manipulating images, and getting a final result. It also includes a lot of tips and tricks! Nothing in the guide is particularly over-the-top in terms of effort - I focus on getting a lot of images generated over getting a few perfect images.

First, I’ll share tips for faces, clothing, and environments. Then, I’ll share my general tips, as well as the checkpoints I like to use.

## How to generate consistent faces

**Tip one: use a TI or LORA.**

To create a consistent character, the two primary methods are creating a LORA or a Textual Inversion. I will not go into detail for this process, but instead focus on what you can do to get the most out of an existing Textual Inversion, which is the method I use. This will also be applicable to LORAs. For a guide on creating a Textual Inversion, I recommend BelieveDiffusion’s guide for a straightforward, step-by-step process for generating a new “person” from scratch. [See it on Github.](https://github.com/BelieveDiffusion/tutorials/blob/main/consistent_character_embedding/README.md)

**Tip two: Don’t sweat the first generation - fix faces with inpainting.**

Very frequently you will generate faces that look totally busted - particularly at “distant” zooms. For example: [https://imgur.com/a/B4DRJNP](https://imgur.com/a/B4DRJNP) \- I like the composition and outfit of this image a lot, but that poor face :(

Here's how you solve that - simply take the image, send it to inpainting, and critically, select “Inpaint Only Masked”. Then, use your TI and a moderately high denoise (\~.6) to fix.

Here it is fixed! [https://imgur.com/a/eA7fsOZ](https://imgur.com/a/eA7fsOZ) Looks great! Could use some touch up, but not bad for a two step process.

**Tip three: Tune faces in photoshop.**

Photoshop gives you a set of tools under “Neural Filters” that make small tweaks easier and faster than reloading into Stable Diffusion. These only work for very small adjustments, but I find they fit into my toolkit nicely. [https://imgur.com/a/PIH8s8s](https://imgur.com/a/PIH8s8s)

**Tip four: add skin texture in photoshop.**

A small trick here, but this can be easily done and really sell some images, especially close-ups of faces. I highly recommend following [this quick guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB4UWK1uj1Y) to add skin texture to images that feel too smooth and plastic.

## How to generate consistent clothing

Clothing is much more difficult because it is a big investment to create a TI or LORA for a single outfit, unless you have a very specific reason. Therefore, this section will focus a lot more on various hacks I have uncovered to get good results.

**Tip five: Use a standard “mood” set of terms in your prompt.**

Preload every prompt you use with a “standard” set of terms that work for your target output. For photorealistic images, I like to use `highly detailed, photography, RAW, instagram, (imperfect skin, goosebumps:1.1)` this set tends to work well with the mood, style, and checkpoints I use. For clothing, this biases the generation space, pushing everything a little closer to each other, which helps with consistency.

**Tip six: use long, detailed descriptions.**

If you provide a long list of prompt terms for the clothing you are going for, and are consistent with it, you’ll get MUCH more consistent results. I also recommend building this list slowly, one term at a time, to ensure that the model understand the term and actually incorporates it into your generations. For example, instead of using `green dress`, use `dark green, (((fashionable))), ((formal dress)), low neckline, thin straps, ((summer dress)), ((satin)), (((Surplice))), sleeveless`

Here’s a **non**\-cherry picked look at what that generates. [https://imgur.com/a/QpEuEci](https://imgur.com/a/QpEuEci) Already pretty consistent!

**Tip seven: Bulk generate and get an idea what your checkpoint is biased towards.**

If you are someone agnostic as to what outfit you want to generate, a good place to start is to generate hundreds of images in your chosen scenario and see what the model likes to generate. You’ll get a diverse set of clothes, but you might spot a repeating outfit that you like. Take note of that outfit, and craft your prompts to match it. Because the model is already biased naturally towards that direction, it will be easy to extract that look, especially after applying tip six.

**Tip eight: Crappily photoshop the outfit to look more like your target, then inpaint/img2img to clean up your photoshop hatchet job.**

I suck at photoshop - but StableDiffusion is there to pick up the slack. Here’s a quick tutorial on changing colors and using the clone stamp, with the SD workflow afterwards

Let’s turn [https://imgur.com/a/GZ3DObg](https://imgur.com/a/GZ3DObg) into a spaghetti strap dress to be more consistent with our target. All I’ll do is take 30 seconds with the clone stamp tool and clone skin over some, but not all of the strap. Here’s the result. [https://imgur.com/a/2tJ7Qqg](https://imgur.com/a/2tJ7Qqg) Real hatchet job, right?

Well let’s have SD fix it for us, and not spend a minute more blending, comping, or learning how to use photoshop well. 

Denoise is the key parameter here, we want to use that image we created, keep it as the baseline, then moderate denoise so it doesn't eliminate the information we've provided. Again, .6 is a good starting point. [https://imgur.com/a/z4reQ36](https://imgur.com/a/z4reQ36) \- note the inpainting. Also make sure you use “original” for masked content! Here’s the result! [https://imgur.com/a/QsISUt2](https://imgur.com/a/QsISUt2) \- First try. This took about 60 seconds total, work and generation, you could do a couple more iterations to really polish it.

This is a very flexible technique! You can add more fabric, remove it, add details, pleats, etc. In the white dress images in my example, I got the relatively consistent flowers by simply crappily photoshopping them onto the dress, then following this process. 

This is a pattern you can employ for other purposes: do a busted photoshop job, then leverage SD with “original” on inpaint to fill in the gap. Let’s change the color of the dress:

* Quickselect the dress, no need to even roto it out. [https://imgur.com/a/im6SaPO](https://imgur.com/a/im6SaPO)
* Ctrl+J for a new layer
* Hue adjust [https://imgur.com/a/FpI5SCP](https://imgur.com/a/FpI5SCP)
* Right click the new layer, click “Create clipping mask”
* Go crazy with the sliders [https://imgur.com/a/Q0QfTOc](https://imgur.com/a/Q0QfTOc)
* Let stable diffusion clean up our mess! Same rules as strap removal above. [https://imgur.com/a/Z0DWepU](https://imgur.com/a/Z0DWepU)

Use this to add sleeves, increase/decrease length, add fringes, pleats, or more. Get creative! And see tip seventeen: squint.

## How to generate consistent environments

**Tip nine: See tip five above.**

Standard mood really helps!

**Tip ten: See tip six above.**

A detailed prompt really helps!

**Tip eleven: See tip seven above.**

The model will be biased in one direction or another. Exploit this!

By now you should realize a problem - this is a lot of stuff to cram in one prompt. Here’s the simple solution: generate a whole composition that blocks out your elements and gets them looking mostly right if you squint, then inpaint each thing - outfit, background, face.

**Tip twelve: Make a set of background “plate”**

Create some scenes and backgrounds without characters in them, then inpaint in your characters in different poses and positions. You can even use img2img and very targeted inpainting to make slight changes to the background plate with very little effort on your part to give a good look.

**Tip thirteen: People won’t mind the small inconsistencies.**

Don’t sweat the little stuff! Likely people will be focused on your subjects. If your lighting, mood, color palette, and overall photography style is consistent, it is very natural to ignore all the little things. For the sake of time, I allow myself the luxury of many small inconsistencies, and no readers have complained yet! I think they’d rather I focus on releasing more content. However, if you do really want to get things perfect, apply selective inpainting, photobashing, and color shifts followed by img2img in a similar manner as tip eight, and you can really dial in anything to be nearly perfect.

## Must-know fundamentals and general tricks:

**Tip fourteen: Understand the relationship between denoising and inpainting types.**

My favorite baseline parameters for an underlying image that I am inpainting is .6 denoise with “masked only” and “original” as the noise fill. I highly, highly recommend experimenting with these three settings and learning intuitively how changing them will create different outputs.

**Tip fifteen: leverage photo collages/photo bashes**

Want to add something to an image, or have something that’s a sticking point, like a hand or a foot? Go on google images, find something that is very close to what you want, and crappily photoshop it onto your image. Then, use the inpainting tricks we’ve discussed to bring it all together into a cohesive image. It’s amazing how well this can work!

**Tip sixteen: Experiment with controlnet.**

I don’t want to do a full controlnet guide, but canny edge maps and depth maps can be very, very helpful when you have an underlying image you want to keep the structure of, but change the style. Check out Aitrepreneur’s many videos on the topic, but know this might take some time to learn properly!

**Tip seventeen: SQUINT!**

When inpainting or img2img-ing with moderate denoise and original image values, you can apply your own noise layer by squinting at the image and seeing what it looks like. Does squinting and looking at your photo bash produce an image that looks like your target, but blurry? Awesome, you’re on the right track.

**Tip eighteen: generate, generate, generate.**

Create hundreds - thousands of images, and cherry pick. Simple as that. Use the “extra large” thumbnail mode in file explorer and scroll through your hundreds of images. Take time to learn and understand the bulk generation tools (prompt s/r, prompts from text, etc) to create variations and dynamic changes.

**Tip nineteen: Recommended checkpoints.**

I like the way Deliberate V2 renders faces and lights portraits. I like the way Cyberrealistic V20 renders interesting and unique positions and scenes. You can find them both on Civitai. What are your favorites? I’m always looking for more.

That’s most of what I’ve learned so far! Feel free to ask any questions in the comments, and make some long form illustrated content yourself and send it to me, I want to see it!

478,StableDiffusion,12u6c76,Can we identify most Stable Diffusion Model issues with just a few circles?,"This is my attempt to diagnose Stable Diffusion models using a small and straightforward set of standard tests based on a few prompts. However, every point I bring up is open to discussion.

[Each row of images corresponds to a different model, with the same prompt for illustrating a circle.](https://preview.redd.it/msieu9d5x7va1.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=caf78146874e3c17217f224742612485d2192e93)

Stable Diffusion models are black boxes that remain mysterious unless we test them with numerous prompts and settings. I have attempted to create a blueprint for a standard diagnostic method to analyze the model and compare it to other models easily. This test includes 5 prompts and can be expanded or modified to include other tests and concerns.

**What the test is assessing?**

1. Text encoder problem: overfitting/corruption.
2. Unet problems: overfitting/corruption.
3. Latent noise.
4. Human body integraty.
5. SFW/NSFW bias.
6. Damage to the base model.

**Findings:** 

It appears that a few prompts can effectively diagnose many problems with a model. Future applications may include automating tests during model training to prevent overfitting and corruption. A histogram of samples shifted toward darker colors could indicate Unet overtraining and corruption. The circles test might be employed to detect issues with the text encoder.

**Prompts used for testing and how they may indicate problems with a model:** (full prompts and settings are attached at the end)

1. Photo of Jennifer Lawrence.
   1. Jennifer Lawrence is a known subject for all SD models (1.3, 1.4, 1.5). A shift in her likeness indicates a shift in the base model.
   2. Can detect body integrity issues.
   3. Darkening of her images indicates overfitting/corruption of Unet.
2. Photo of woman:
   1. Can detect body integrity issues.
   2. NSFW images indicate the model's NSFW bias.
3. Photo of a naked woman.
   1. Can detect body integrity issues.
   2. SFW images indicate the model's SFW bias.
4. City streets.
   1. Chaotic streets indicate latent noise.
5. Illustration of a circle.
   1. Absence of circles, colors, or complex scenes suggests issues with the text encoder.
   2. Irregular patterns, noise, and deformed circles indicate noise in latent space.

**Examples of detected problems:**

1. The likeness of Jennifer Lawrence is lost, suggesting that the model is heavily overfitted. An example of this can be seen in ""Babes\_Kissable\_Lips\_1.safetensors."":

https://preview.redd.it/mn9p9vlg09va1.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=08bc5171748e1b6d88cbe5faf1db5dfc976eed6a

2. Darkening of the image may indicate Unet overfitting. An example of this issue is present in ""vintedois\_diffusion\_v02.safetensors."":

https://preview.redd.it/659t88oi19va1.png?width=1328&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f2697cee33973af06738de847c601c513c108db2

3. NSFW/SFW biases are easily detectable in the generated images.

4. Typically, models generate a single street, but when noise is present, it creates numerous busy and chaotic buildings, example from ""analogDiffusion\_10.safetensors"":

https://preview.redd.it/adtawgqt29va1.png?width=1307&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5cd7b3f91800e8d90304c62f21bde2773ccae6e8

5. Model producing a woman instead of circles and geometric shapes, an example from ""sdHeroBimboBondage\_1.safetensors"". This is likely caused by an overfitted text encoder that pushes every prompt toward a specific subject, like ""woman.""

https://preview.redd.it/gnm7wt23y7va1.png?width=1058&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fc7ec39721147c70a6fec8c8c2c9747c6b3e0737

6. Deformed circles likely indicate latent noise or strong corruption of the model, as seen in ""StudioGhibliV4.ckpt.""

https://preview.redd.it/0izc8dy7i8va1.png?width=1319&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=27cf14f3df77b0628cd87272c86c28b9ea10bdf5

**Stable Models:**

Stable models generally perform better in all tests, producing well-defined and clean circles. An example of this can be seen in ""hassanblend1512And\_hassanblend1512.safetensors."":

https://preview.redd.it/llwqlblt49va1.png?width=1139&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9969fd90d309c99ee024dac14ae1241f65806b5e

**Data:**

Tested approximately 120 models. JPG files of \~45MB each might be challenging to view on a slower PC; I recommend downloading and opening with an image viewer capable of handling large images: [1](https://files.catbox.moe/yarybs.jpg), [2](https://files.catbox.moe/fxkq51.jpg), [3](https://files.catbox.moe/g0kpmv.jpg), [4](https://files.catbox.moe/ub3elt.jpg), [5](https://files.catbox.moe/tfhili.jpg).

**Settings:**

5 prompts with 7 samples (batch size 7), using AUTOMATIC 1111, with the setting: ""Prevent empty spots in grid (when set to autodetect)"" - which does not allow grids of an odd number to be folded, keeping all samples from a single model on the same row.

479,StableDiffusion,12mcada,"EU's AI Act: Generative AI platforms must disclose use of copyrighted training data or face ban. Stability AI, Midjourney fall in this bucket.","The AI Act has been under development in the EU since 2021 (after all, it's the EU) but recently lawmakers have rapidly been updating it with new proposals to specifically regulate generative A platforms.

[I do a full breakdown here](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/eus-ai-act-stricter-rules-for-chatbots-on-the-horizon) as this law could have major implications for the future development of AI in general. 

**The lawmakers have already proposed categorizing Stability AI as ""high-risk"" designation, similar to how they would categorize ChatGPT.**

**Why this is important:**

OpenAI has refused to disclose much of the details of how they trained GPT-4, especially what data went into training it.

Already, copyright lawsuits against Stability AI are winding their way through the courts and could spell trouble for LLM-powered chatbots too. The two most prominent cases against Stability AI are a suit by Getty Images and a class-action suit by a group of artists, all alleging misuse of copyrighted images.

It'll be interesting to see if this forces their hand and also causes other platforms to have to play very cautiously with the training data they use, much of which was publicly scraped but without user consent.

482,StableDiffusion,12k30db,How much ownership do you guys feel over the art you generate?,"I've been dabbling with gen AI for about a month now (coming from a traditional artist background), it's been kind of addicting honestly seeing as churned through like....7000+ images in my first week. Started with NAI then I learned what A1111 is and Civitai and went from there. 

However,  I've noticed I kind of struggle with feeling any ownership over the things I create with it; on a singular image level. Now, this can happen with making art the manual way too, as I have plenty of commissions I made in the  past years that I'm like....I don't even remember I made that now, and it's probably better that I don't in some cases. 

With SD so far though, even if I spend a while optimizing the prompt and inpainting etc, and I get the desired output 1-2 hours later, after the initial 5 minute of novelty disappear....I could honestly not care less if it gets deleted, or someone prints it out to wipe their butt with it, etc. I probably won't even remember I made it the day tomorrow. It just doesn't give me that ""nice"" feeling that I made something, I guess. 

I don't think ""time and effort"" is all there is to it, as I said, there's been work I handcrafted for hours I couldn't care about or don't remember, but there were also spontaneous 20 minute sketches that stick in my mind or made me feel ""Damn, I did that, that's mine"". But no generation so far really has given me that feeling.

Tl;DR I am curious how other people feel about it, do you have any problems feeling pride in your pieces or taking in the the ""joy of creation"" while generating stuff?",127,60,0.92,2023-04-13 02:04:45,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/12k30db/how_much_ownership_do_you_guys_feel_over_the_art/,Feisty-Pay-5361,289
483,StableDiffusion,12h2cyd,SDXL consistently gives me much less useful results than SD 1.5,"I'm a professional graphic designer and illustrator. I began integrating Stable Diffusion 1.5 into my workflow last year and have found it genuinely useful, so I was quite excited for the SDXL beta, but after banging my head against it for a few days... it just can't seem to do any of the things that make SD 1.5 useful to me.

I've spent thousands of hours screwing around with image models, going all the way back to the days of homebrew colab notebooks a few years ago, and I've concluded that what I need from an image model is basically two things:

The first is responsiveness and specificity (i.e., I can quickly narrow in on what I want via prompting). SDXL is non-functional in this regard. It's somehow both over-responsive and under-responsive at the same time. You give it a short, vague prompt and all the results look the same even at a low weight, which means there's no way to search for oddball results that are interesting or useful, and on which you can then iterate. But a minute later you give it a negative prompt, and even after cranking the weight way up it has no appreciable effect on the results. It also does this thing where it seems to fixate on one salient token in the prompt in a way that washes out everything else, which results in a lot more ""blurring together"" of different parts of the prompt and makes it very difficult to create an image that combines incongruous subjects or styles.

The second is aesthetic breadth and depth, the model needs to have a wide range of ""knowledge"" that allows the user to exploit their own idiosyncratic knowledge of the visual world in order to find tokens that will produce similarly idiosyncratic results. SDXL is terrible at this. Again, and again, I'll given it a word or phrase that I know is linked to a particular kind of images, and it just... doesn't work. Other models do this too, of course, but it's an occasional issue that occurs when you run into some gap in their knowledge, SDXL does it *constantly*, and with stuff that isn't remotely obscure, like time periods and whole countries. This is a *huge* problem, because tokens like these are the ingredients that can be combined to produce a desired aesthetic.

I whipped up a series of prompts in DreamStudio that I think do a good job of demonstrating these problems. The first image of each pair is from SD 1.5, the second is SDXL. All the settings are the same, prompt weight: 8, steps: 50, and no ""style"" (which I at first mistekenly thought was the source of these problems). To keep things fair, these are also the first set of results from each model. I didn't reroll until I got something good from SD 1.5 or something crappy from SDXL. I've written a short commentary on each.

*""An embarrassing yearbook photo from 2004 of a mall goth.""*: This one is particularly glaring. The SD 1.5 results are great! Every part of the prompt is there, and it completely captures the ultra-niche aesthetic I had in mind, these are not 1991 goth kids, these are not cool artsy goths, these are 2004 mall goths. In contrast, the SDXL results seem to have no relation to the prompt at all apart from the word ""goth"", the fact that the faces are (a bit) more coherent is completely worthless because these images are *simply not reflective of the prompt*.

[SD 1.5](https://preview.redd.it/5xjwvwcukssa1.png?width=2026&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4b79aa86b131061f6a4a6a6f2256b35add378e56)

*""Cover art from a 1990s SF paperback, featuring a detailed and realistic illustration. \[Lois McMaster Bujold, David Weber, Honor Harrington, The Man-Kzin, Baen, Ballantine, Tor, Bantam\]"":* Another effort to capture a niche aesthetic, in this case the kind of illustrations that graced the cover of mass market SF paperbacks in the '90s. And once again SDXL completely shits the bed. The results are just bland, bland, bland, and what's even worse, extremely homogeneous. This is a great example of the problem I talked about above, if the results all look the same even at a low prompt weight then it's impossible to iterate. Look how much more varied and ""creative"" the SD 1.5 results are.

""A mixed media piece by Henry Darger."" This one is a little more subtle, because the SDXL results are not *terrible*, they just look nothing like Henry Darger. SDXL seems to know the names of way fewer artists, which is perhaps intentional? If they excluded artists from the training data alongside NSFW stuff then that's fair enough, but my point is that a token like ""Henry Darger"" should allow you to invoke a very specific aesthetic. Even if you're not looking to create a pastiche, being able to add a pinch of Darger's characteristic composition, pallet, etc. is extremely useful, and SDXL can't do it.

*“An award-winning photograph taken in 1989 showing a group of young Russian men on a street corner in Moscow. \[Nikon F-801, close-up, natural lighting\]”*: A similar example to the last one, but this time with some non-artist tokens. I genuinely don't understand what's going on here. Why are SDXL's results so much worse? And again, look how much more homogeneous the SDXL images are. What on earth in the prompt is making all the men look like fashion models? Like with the Henry Darger example, what's important is not that SDXL whiffed on this prompt, but that its unresponsiveness to (pretty simple) prompt like this reflects a general lack of aesthetic breadth and depth.

[SD 1.5](https://preview.redd.it/85k07zcukssa1.png?width=2026&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=250562acced69de6142396f0c1984e2d7a913ef3)

So anyways, that's why I'm going to keep using SD 1.5 for now! And I hope they find a way to fix whatever the heck is going on here before SDXL is released for real.",84,100,0.95,2023-04-10 04:12:39,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/12h2cyd/sdxl_consistently_gives_me_much_less_useful/,herocksinalab,952
484,StableDiffusion,12zix4c,New copyright law on AI-Generated content in progress,"You've probably seen AI-generated images before or even tried your hand at creating some yourself. Well, get this: On 16/03/2023, the Copyright Office issued a statement of policy that clarifies its practices for examining and registering works containing material created by AI content. We're talking about authorship, the use of partially generated AI content in art, and other important regulations.

What are your thoughts about legality when it comes to AI art? Will this affect the industry positively or just expose the idea of AI art to more of the public? Let’s discuss!

[Copyright Registration Guidance: Works Containing Material Generated by Artificial Intelligence](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/03/16/2023-05321/copyright-registration-guidance-works-containing-material-generated-by-artificial-intelligence#print)

**GPT4 summary** of the main points addressed if you don’t care to read ;)

The U.S. Copyright Office has released a policy statement clarifying their approach to the registration of works containing material generated by artificial intelligence (AI) technology (FR Doc. 2023-05321). This is a crucial topic for artists, writers, programmers, and anyone involved with AI-generated content. Here are the key takeaways from this policy statement:

1. **Human authorship is still a requirement**: As per the Copyright Act, protection is only granted to works of human authorship. AI-generated content, as it stands, does not meet this criterion, making it *ineligible for copyright protection*.
2. **Inputs and AI-generated outputs:** If a human author provides inputs (e.g., prompts) to an AI system, the copyright protection may apply to the *human-authored input*, but not to the AI-generated output. The AI output is considered a product of the machine, not the human.
3. **Compilations and derivative works:** If an AI-generated work is part of a larger compilation or a derivative work created by a human author, copyright protection may extend to the compilation or derivative work, but it will not cover the AI-generated content within it.
4. **Registering AI-generated works:** For registering a work that includes AI-generated content, applicants must specifically identify the AI-generated material and disclaim copyright protection for it. The U.S. Copyright Office may add an annotation to the registration certificate to clarify the scope of the claim.
5. **Supplementary registration:** If a work has already been registered and is later found to include AI-generated material, a supplementary registration can be filed to correct the information on the original registration certificate.

It is important to clarify however that, in some cases, a work containing AI-generated material also contains sufficient human authorship to support a copyright claim. For example, a human may select or arrange AI-generated material in a sufficiently creative way that “the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship.” Or an artist may modify material originally   generated by AI technology to such a degree that the modifications meet the standard for copyright protection.

Kind regards <3

\-Alex

\[EDIT\]Thanks for the kind words! As for the prompts/workflow, it's a bit odd. I was playing around with text-to-image generators for a while, but it wasn't until I started working in a museum last year that I came up with a two-word prompt based on early 20th century modern artists that I use for all my generations (That for some reason works really well on Stable Diffusion 1, but no other version or other generators). It's what keeps the stylistic consistency and so I refer to it as my ""seed prompt"". Then I add one or two words for 'flair'. The seed prompt I'm honestly still a bit 'protective' of, as it feels like my own secret ingredient, but I do think I want to eventually let people know, just not yet... \^\_\^'

So once I've settled on a 'theme' I'll start generating. I calculated that on average I'm looking at 5000-10000 images per hour and save maybe a couple dozen that are actually decent. All of the ones I save are given the title of the flair prompt and then a number and letter. So for example: ""Cyberpunk Lovers 5c"" would mean that the full prompt was ""SEEDWORD1 SEEDWORD2 Cyberpunk Lovers"" and that it's the 5th image out of many that I chose to save, and 'c' means it's the bottom left out of the 4 generated images. Then I use 'imgupscaler' to upscale them twice to get to \~6000x6000-8000x8000 resolution. You should see some of these full-size, pretty crazy, wish I had a bigger screen! :)

I think I'm a little crazy, because I doubt there's anyone doing it like this, but who knows... let me know! (I must've seen literally MILLIONS of images by now lol)

489,StableDiffusion,1381nmu,How to use Dynamic Prompts for image diversity [Tutorial],"\-- **Introduction** \--

Sometimes when making images you may come up with a great concept that could include many different elements, but you want to mix-and-match different prompt components instead of using them all at once.

For example, you want a photo of a dog in either a blanket, or in a basket, but not both a blanket *and* a basket.  Or a cat that is brown or black or white - but not calico.

You could use an an X/Y/Z grid with search and replace, or manually make prompts and run them with the ""prompts from file"" option, but both of these have limitations and could be time consuming.

As a solution to this problem, I'd like to do a short tutorial on how to use one of my favorite extensions: Dynamic Prompts. This tool allows you to assign different variable options to a portion of your prompt, which will then be selected when each image is generated.

Some of the information terms used to create my wildcard files can be found my tutorial on how to create realistic humans.

As always, I suggest reading my previous tutorials as well, but this is by no means necessary:

&#x200B;

\-- **Setup --**

For this tutorial we will be using Automatic 1111 and the [SD Dynamics Prompt](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompts) extension, found in the extensions tab of the UI.  In the Dynamic Prompts 'advanced options,' the ""unlink seed from prompt,"" setting was turned on - more about this later.

The model used for this example is RealisticVision 1.4, but this doesn't have any impact on the tutorial, so feel free to use whatever model you prefer. Generations were started on seed 200, with Euler A sampler and 20 steps at 512x904 resolution.

All prompts end with the recommended (word-vomit) prompt template provided by the model:

`(high detailed skin:1.2), dslr, soft lighting, high quality, film grain, detailed skin texture, (highly detailed hair), sharp body, highly detailed body, (realistic), soft focus, insanely detailed, highest quality`

I questioned if all of these words are necessary, or even useful, so I ran a prompt matrix cutting one word off the back at a time:

[Cutting back prompt example](https://i.imgur.com/X1bbOrX.jpg)

For the purpose of this tutorial I'll leave them in though, but I always recommend doing some research on your own and seeing if you really need all the words in your prompt to get the desired outcome.

This model can result in nude photos often, so `((nude))` and `((nsfw))` were added to the equally word vomity negative prompt of:

`(deformed iris, deformed pupils, semi-realistic, cgi, 3d, render, sketch, cartoon, drawing, anime:1.4), text, close up, cropped, out of frame, worst quality, low quality, jpeg artifacts, ugly, duplicate, morbid, mutilated, extra fingers, mutated hands, poorly drawn hands, poorly drawn face, mutation, deformed, blurry, dehydrated, bad anatomy, bad proportions, extra limbs, cloned face, disfigured, gross proportions, malformed limbs, missing arms, missing legs, extra arms, extra legs, fused fingers, too many fingers, long neck`

Since these prompts and negative prompts will be used with every image, for the sake of brevity, they will be omitted when mentioning prompts below.

&#x200B;

**-- Simple Two Variable Option --**

To start things off, lets see how to use the most basic feature of Dynamic Prompts, which allows you to randomly select between two different variables.  This is done by using an opening curly bracket, a term, a pipe delimiter, a second term, and a closing curly bracket such as this:

`{man|woman}`

We can then take this variable and input it in our prompt like so:

`photo, {man|woman}, athletic clothes`

Using this, we will generate a photo of either a man, or a woman, wearing athleticwear.  Clothes have been added to this prompt due to the fact that both the ""NSFW"" and ""nude"" negative prompts weren't cutting it.

Results: [Man or woman wearing athletic clothes](https://i.imgur.com/SF2k9g0.jpg)

Interestingly we came back with three men and five women, but when looking at the individual prompts that were generated, one of the images said ""man"" but resulted in a photo of a woman.  This may be result of the seed, model data, or both.

&#x200B;

**-- Weighted Two Variable Option --**

I repeated this test by generating 90 more images and still found a substantially larger number of female images were created than male.  To combat this, we can use weighted prompts, which will allow us to tell one variable to be picked more often than the other.

To weight your prompts you will add a weight number and two colons before your first variable term.  A '2' would result in twice as many selections of your variable, a '3' triple the amount, and so on.

To really drive home the difference in male versus female generations I went with the following prompt:

`photo, {4::man|woman}, athletic clothes`

Results: [4x man versus woman selections](https://i.imgur.com/mvfnQJj.jpg)

With this change we now have six men and three women.

&#x200B;

\-- **Choosing Many Variables with Wildcard Options --**

Lets say that we have more than two options we'd like to cycle through. We could continue to stack variables like so:

`{man|woman|group|dog}`

This works fine for just a few variables, but let's say you want to use a list of 10, 20, or 100 variables.  This is where wildcard options come in.

To start off using wildcards, we will want to find the new, ""Wildcards Manager,"" tab that came with the Dynamic Prompts extension.  From here you can either click the ""select a collection"" button and download a preset list of items, such as artists, or create your own; which will be the focus of this tutorial.

To create a new wildcard list you will first need to navigate to the following path:

*\~your-SD-install-path-here\\extensions\\sd-dynamic-prompts\\wildcards*

Once you are in the wildcards folder, create a new folder that will hold your set of wildcards.  For this tutorial I will be creating a folder called ""people,"" giving me a final path of:

*C:\\SD\\PY2\\extensions\\sd-dynamic-prompts\\wildcards\\people*

Inside of this folder, create a new text file with a name that will describe the included variables.  The first one I am creating is called ""photo.txt,"" which will contain variables to replace the generic `photo` in our prompt with terms that I prefer as photo framing options.

In your text document, simply type one variable per line and then save.

[Example of a wildcard variable text file](https://i.imgur.com/jluPapK.png)

With your file done, click the ""refresh wildcards"" button within the Wildcard Manager tab and your new file [should appear in the selection tree](https://i.imgur.com/T9B7bvO.png).

You will then want to copy and paste the ""wildcards file"" variable listed on the right hand side.  If you used the same folder and file names that I used, it will be, ""\_\_people/photo\_\_""

We can now use this variable in our prompt, allowing Dynamic Prompts to select randomly from one of the items:

`{__people/photo__}, {man|woman}, athletic clothes`

Results: [Photo wildcard selections](https://i.imgur.com/mpRJaux.jpg)

Now that is a pretty subtle change, but we can combine multiple wildcards longer prompts to further impact our image.

First we will add in some different jobs, and swap to using just, ""`clothes`,"" so the attire can match the profession:

`{__people/photo__}, {man|woman}, {__people/jobs__}, clothes`

Results: [Adding in jobs to photos](https://i.imgur.com/jNkZU2w.jpg)

Depending on the job, not all really have a defining uniform, so you may need to adjust your wildcard file to fit your results, culling anything that doesn't impact your final image.  This can be done by either editing the text file directly, or through the Web UI interface.

Next we'll stack on some actions our models may be performing:

`{__people/photo__}, {man|woman}, {__people/jobs__}, clothes, {__people/actions__}`

Results: [Add in actions to photos](https://i.imgur.com/fP9aWxD.jpg)

This may, or may not, make sense to do, and instead you may want to have one file that combines both actions and jobs into a single line.  For example, instead of having ""doctor"" in one file for jobs, and them performing a list of unrelated doctor actions from your actions file, you may want to make a file that combines jobs and actions, such as, ""doctor performing surgery,"" and ""doctor looking at xrays,"" instead.

Another great use for dynamic prompts is to create different settings, times of day, and weather effects:

`{__people/photo__}, {man|woman}, {__people/jobs__}, clothes, ({__people/location__})`

`{__people/photo__}, {man|woman}, {__people/jobs__}, clothes, ({__people/tod})`

`{__people/photo__}, {man|woman}, {__people/jobs__}, clothes, ({__people/weather})`

`{__people/photo__}, {man|woman}, {__people/jobs__}, clothes, ({__people/location__}), {__people/tod__}, (({__people/weather}))`

Results: [Adding a location](https://i.imgur.com/meNu22I.jpg)

Results: [Adding a time of day](https://i.imgur.com/AojHFiu.jpg)

Results: [Adding weather](https://i.imgur.com/UcoqvkP.jpg) \- special bonus image of weird, wet, George Clooney's lost brother

Results: [Adding a location, time of day, and weather](https://i.imgur.com/OOKOefd.jpg)

Note you can still add attention to wildcard prompt using parentheses ().

Alternatively you can skip all three of those and find a word that describes the environment, such as ""shadowy,"" ""cold,"" ""foggy,"" or, ""wet.""

\-- **Picking a Range of Variables --**

Now, picking one variable out of a giant list is fun and all, but let's say we want to pick between 1 and X number of variables.  To achieve this we use a selection number, or range of numbers, followed by $$.

For example, if we wanted to select 2 objects to add to our photo we could this:

`{__people/photo__}, {man|woman}, {__people/jobs__}, clothes, ({2$$__people/objects})`

or

`{__people/photo__}, {man|woman}, {__people/jobs__}, clothes, ({2$$pen|lamp|bed|fork})`

Results: [Selecting two variables from a list](https://i.imgur.com/TE5pXlX.jpg)

Often times objects look forced, or out of place, when added in, so use with caution.

Instead of selecting just two of something, we can give it a range of numbers to select from.  Let's say we wanted 1-3 objects, you'd use the following prompt:

`{__people/photo__}, {man|woman}, {__people/jobs__}, clothes, ({1-3$$__people/objects})`

Also, if you want to use ""and"" instead of a comma for the variables you can use this prompt:

`{__people/photo__}, {man|woman}, {__people/jobs__}, clothes, ({1-3$$ and $$__people/objects})`

Results: [Selecting between one and three variables from a list](https://imgur.com/4uri0JU).

Using this range, you could for example make a beach scene that could sometimes include sand castles, clams, and buckets, or maybe two of them, or maybe all three.

&#x200B;

\-- **Unlink Seed from Prompt --**

As a special note, if you were to run the same dynamic prompt, on the same seed, you would always get the same results.  This would make it appear that the dynamic prompt really isn't all that dynamic at all.

In order to change this, go into the advanced options section and select, ""unlink seed from prompt.""  This will allow any seed, to use any variable.

The downside to this is that you can't just give your dynamic prompt and seed number out for repeatability, as what is selected would change each time it is ran.  However, you can still seee the final resulting prompt for a given image by brining it into the PNG info tab..

&#x200B;

\-- **Conclusion --**

Although we will most likely not want to be as full-on random in our prompting as was on display here today, when used in conjunction with a particular theme, dynamic prompts can give you a great amount of variability and diversity to your images.  I highly recommend building a library of common prompt themes - rather that be hair styles, clothing options, or favorite artists - to help streamline your workflow and open up your images to more variety.

As always, let me know if you have any questions or need further help.

491,StableDiffusion,12l7nc4,The SDXL beta is really great and disappointing at the same time.,"I will not give you images because unless I created some comparisons with a similar prompt and tried enough different styles it wouldn't say much anyway. Instead go try it yourself for styles that you care about, it's available for anyone with an account at [Dreamstudio](https://dreamstudio.ai/generate) and the free tier gets enough credits for 30 images.   
  
It seems to be getting better, [which is confirmed by Emad](https://nitter.net/EMostaque/status/1646583898338643968#m), the images I got were much better than what I saw from others when the beta first came out.  
  
I don't watch the latest and best custom models too much, but compared to those that I've seen SDXL is 100% more coherent and therefore realistic. Especially so when compared to vanilla models. Though not close in coherency to Midjourney v5.  
  
However it also further removes any individual artists from its database, which was to be expected, but it's still sad to see. I never used artist names to recreate their style (and I never used Rutkowski), but using various more niche artist names in a prompt often helped steer it in an interesting and unique direction, dissimilar from both their actual style and anything else, something that's very difficult to achieve without them.  
  
As an example, I used Tsutomu Nihei, the author of [Blame! manga](https://c.neevacdn.net/image/fetch/s--ZPTeXyoY--/https%3A//i.pinimg.com/originals/bc/7a/e5/bc7ae541a8f753a7ed50182fd8556f17.jpg?savepath=bc7ae541a8f753a7ed50182fd8556f17.jpg), which, despite being a manga, has absolutely nothing to do with the common anime style and instead is about traversing dystopian scifi megastructures. It worked really well to influence the style of brutalist or cyberpunk cityscapes. Or [Jan Švankmajer](https://c.neevacdn.net/image/fetch/s--7JDWolPG--/https%3A//1.bp.blogspot.com/-85H4L7W_RoI/XuScLccLhfI/AAAAAAAA4pM/9bGOm0oNNhIAgIjR7gtJScs99rtGu8_hQCPcBGAsYHg/w780/jExkMK7bByCh4AjpEa4eOixtnUt.jpg?savepath=jExkMK7bByCh4AjpEa4eOixtnUt.jpg), a great film maker who used to make dark surrealist stop-motion animation - using his name never really created something that looks like his work, but it did create some really interesting surreal weirdness.  
  
Both of these great men are known decently well by SD 1.5, noticeably less so by 2.1 and seemingly not at all by SDXL.  
  
This is very disappointing, because the effect of general uncensored training of 1.4 and 1.5 is probably not going to happen again and I don't think custom training will help. I don't want to train the model to *recreate* their work, I want it to slightly know many interesting artists in order to create happy accidents and steer the results in unforeseen directions. I don't think the community will ever recreate that (until we all get futuristic hardware that can train on the entire LAION dataset ourselves).",34,55,0.91,2023-04-14 01:03:08,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/12l7nc4/the_sdxl_beta_is_really_great_and_disappointing/,Vozka,415

501,StableDiffusion,138rpud,My Dreambooth Model Only Works Well for Half-Body Images,"So, I've got a newbie question for you all. I recently trained my Dreambooth model, and it's been somewhat successful. However, it only generates images that resemble the subject when it shows half of the body. The resemblance score is pretty high for headshots, and it's still decent for images showing a bit more of the upper body, but as soon as it goes beyond the chest, the score drops to less than 50%. And if the image shows anything beyond the waist, it's pretty much zero.

I used 25 images to train the model, 16 of which were headshots, and 9 were half-body shots showing some of the upper leg. The training process involved 2500 steps using the LuckyStrikeMix model. I read somewhere that it needs 100 steps per training image - is that true? The training images were 512 x 512, and the generated images were also 512 x 512. I mostly used the ""DPM++ 2M Karras"" model with a ""CFG Scale"" of 7. Also, I noticed that when I generated an image showing more than head to waist, the sampling step needs to be a lot higher. Otherwise, the final image's face looks like it's coming from a horror movie.

So, what did I do wrong? Should I have added some full-body shots to the training images? I also noticed that some LoRA that I found on CivitAI had the same issue. Is this a common problem with Stable Diffusion?

506,StableDiffusion,12zfgi7,Do different models react differently to various prompt keyword strengths?,"Hi -

I am trying to replicate the look of a particular SD artist whose work I enjoy, mainly for learning and analytic/comparison purposes. I have obtained the prompt (positive and negative) and other parameters by examining the PNG metadata of several of his images, including the seed, sampler, etc. I do NOT, however, have the model name, only the hash (e23bdfd419). There is mention of denoising strength, so I'm assuming that he's using img2img or ControlNet in at least the final iteration.

My problem is that I can reproduce everything about the characters and setting with a great deal of fidelity to the original... except for the character's muscularity. When I run the seed with the original parameters, the muscularity is absent. There is only one reference to it in the prompt (muscle tone: 1.4), but the AI seems to ignore it unless I add my own keyword and strength. Then, I get close... but not really a cigar. I have tried various models and samplers, but end up with the same unsatisfactory result.

What am I missing? There are no obvious indications in the prompt to embeddings/textual inversions (that I can tell) or the like, so is it possible that the artist is using a model that is reacting to his muscle tone prompt in a vary particular way? Or could he be using a TI/embedding in the earliest iteration of the finished images? Can the model be identified in some way other that the hash? I did find an embedding on Civitai that perhaps might help IF I can use it with photoreal models [https://civitai.com/models/4933/janrock-style-ti](https://civitai.com/models/4933/janrock-style-ti).  I noticed that his high step count (110) does make a difference, but here MUST be some reason why my results for muscularity are far less pronounced based on his original prompt and parameters unless I add my own keyword and emphasis.

508,StableDiffusion,12nuzr8,"It's time to talk about this. A discussion regarding copyrighting models, and Luditte-like behavior in our community.","So guys, i am confused about something and dare to say, irritated as well. While browsing online here on reddit and civitai finding models, i stumble upon ones that the creator has set a strong disclaimer along the lines of ""COMMERCIAL USE/FINE TUNING/etc PROHIBITED"". 

Some of them like the Camelia mix owner go as far as to remove them from civitai because they found out people were sharing/using art created with their model commercially. 

So my question is, do they have any legal basis for setting these prohibitions? Or is it just a ""request"" from them/they think they own the copyright or something. Because in my understanding, in order to create these models they use resources that are not theirs (either merging existing models, either training on existing art). Even if they have trained the model on their very own art (which I doubt it from the examples I've seen), don't they fall in the same category as all the artists that had the AI train on their art (among all the millions/billions of images online) to produce the original stable diffusion model? 

With these in mind, I'm wondering, is anyone else not bothered by this? Isn't this exactly Luddite behavior like the artists trying to sabotage AI art development/wanting a cut from every art generated by stable diffusion? They merged/trained/made a cool model, and shared it for people to use. Why are they bothered so much by people sharing art even commercially having used their models or fine tuning them, especially if they have no legal copyright basis and they don't own the resources that they used to create the model? Isn't the whole point of our community to be open sourced, like the very foundation of the resources we use is an open sourced database - even if the Luddites want to bring this system down and cease its development? 

In my opinion these people miss the point of this community and/or are quite clueless regarding the legality of their requests/disclaimers.

511,StableDiffusion,12p5efw,A variety of AI art generated by a single meta prompt to GPT-4.,"Someone on Facebook asked why people use ChatGPT to help them generate prompts for AI art generation tools. Good question!

The reason is, because it's extremely good at it if you ask it nicely. Here's a full example of how to do it, using GPT-4, which I've done just now in response to Miles's question. https://sharegpt.com/c/3mrqHWH

The LLM can generate an unlimited number of interesting ideas based on whatever sort of art you would like it to make, in this case I asked for 10 prompts for ""a fashion photoshoot with a glamour model"". These are not ideas that I would have come up with myself, and needless to say, this is a lot quicker and easier than fine-tuning prompts yourself, unless you are very good at it and very quick at it.

You be the judge, do you think that these images are any good? Bear in mind that all of these diverse images come from a single human meta-prompting chat with GPT-4. There was very little human effort involved, and the whole process could easily be automated. I might do that, and post the results to social media each day.

I really like these generations, and I'm sure that a more experienced AI artist and prompt wrangler could do even better with this method.

AI is surely coming for our jobs, even image gen prompting! Now we need to be meta-prompters, and no doubt the AI is better at that than we are too. I might try a meta^2 prompt next, ask GPT-4 to figure out how to prompt itself to make even better images... :)

Here are the images I generated using its prompts. I generated four large images for each of its ideas. These are just the four randomly-seeded images it generated for each prompt. I did not cherry-pick good images, but in spite of that I think there is only one image in the whole bunch that isn't good.

I've been absolutely blown away at some of the stuff I've been getting from this (semi-)random prompt extension! I'm surprised I don't see more people talking about [One Button Prompt](https://github.com/AIrjen/OneButtonPrompt), it's really pushed me out of the normal ideas and styles I would choose.

Obviously the images in the imgur gallery need inpainting and upscaling but the sheer range and inventiveness you can push out, over and over, I love it! I've got a folder of hundreds of these now, for inspiration.

Workflow: I just picked a few key prompts to be consistent, added a negative embedding and my normal anti-CG prompts, then let it do its thing. I think turning down the complexity in the extension and CFG to between 3-5 works really well, letting the extension do its thing to surprise you. You can constrain the prompts to particular styles or subjects, so all of these are humanoid concept art, using ""popular artists"".

518,StableDiffusion,130l7sq,I have a vaguely interesting question about prompts based on a recurring results (workflow included),"I have a little world building project I've been doing to figure out SD, checkpoints and their differences, impact of LoRA vs checkpoint, and the power of the prompts. That's the gist of it anyway, as an artist I'm trying to understand what this tool is capable of, what it's good at, and how to use it to best satisfy my needs.

Anyway, I have a number of characters I generate full body, half body and portrait outputs of and then I compare the subtle differences between every setting. A few days ago I made fixed prompts for a few different characters and ran them through a bunch of checkpoints and LoRA and added stylisation prompts such as artists (Clyde Caldwell, John Berkey, H. R. Giger for easily discernable features) and styles (like oil painting, pencil sketch, photo) using X/Y/Z plot. This raised a question because across 100s of different settings, **one of the prompts would always produce the very same character with slightly different details and angle.** This prompt:

    ""medium shot portrait of a (mature woman:1.2), [experienced hunter|wise mentor],
     [blonde|white] wavy hair, tan rough skin, [ocean blue|greyblue|lightblue] eyes,
     strong wide jaw, [elvish (black ink facepaint:1.1):0.67], leather armor, woven
     scarf, (realism:1.2), fantasy, (autumn forest background:1.3)""
    
    Steps: 24-72, CFG: 3.5-10.5, Resolution: 512x768, 
    Clip skip: 1-3, Seed: same across settings, and also different random seeds
    
    A few checkpoints: deliberate_v2, DreamShaper_4bakedvae and 5, verisimilitude_Dark,
     revAnimated_v11, Openjourney_v4, RPG_v4 (there were more, but you get the idea)

If you think my prompts are silly, well I think as an artist and use keywords that make sense to me, I know these wouldn't get you far on Google nor on a booru site. I'm trying to figure out if the AI can understand me. Feel free to bring feedback, but I'm not looking for prompt advice. I'm trying to figure out why this creates only *one* person.

Feel free to try it yourself and post your results. I want to not show mine yet because I want people to engage with the question and not analyze my output by comparing it to the prompt. Suffice to say there are many characters I could design by hand that would fit this description, so to me it is nonsensical that this produces the very same person every time.

My only answer to the question without understanding how an AI calculates prompts, is that there are very few mature women with tan skin AND blonde hair AND a wide jaw in the training data, so it has few images to use as reference to draw an average from. This would imply to me that the AI is not very good at mixing different images together and instead uses images that match the most with as many keywords as possible. But that hinges on the initial hypothesis being correct.

Also, to clarify, my other prompts generate unique outputs even if some outputs are more similar than others, this one prompt is extremely rigid for lack of a better word.",10,0,0.33,2023-04-27 15:52:58,Question | Help,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/130l7sq/i_have_a_vaguely_interesting_question_about/,linuxlut,531

520,StableDiffusion,1391dv0,An Idea on ensuring AI Art is legal in certain matters (Please read on more info!),"Okay! **A Disclaimer**, I an an AI Artist/Illustration Artist as a hobby and I do not have biases and prejudices against both of these fields.

Just for context. I am not aware of the legal situations now surrounding AI Art and am currently busy on my Studies and Job. This is something that flashed by in my head yesterday and I am willing to accept any input that it is a bad idea, as long as there is a good reason as to why it is a bad idea. Also, I am intending this to be a constructive thread as to how we can resolve this issue in a way that is positive for Illustration Artists and AI Artists.

Now without futher ado, Here is an Idea:

""""""

*An idea for (somehow) making sure that AI generated images are still held by the original artist copyright. A tool that scans the image and identifies (through AI) which artists have their work used as references for the image. From there the art is then given the copyright watermarks and signatures of the artists name to ensure that (while their work was used as reference for the final image) it can't be used as the users original work and they have to use the paid version to get the watermarks off (because by then, the artist whose work is involved is getting paid for the AI using it as reference).*

""""""

This was mostly based on the AI Text Detectors that exist to detect AI Text. I am aware that the problem could be much larger than just this simple matter, but this could be a starting point in ensuring that Artists still maintain control over their work while still being (again, I am not sure if it is fair use or not...) legal. Also, building an AI Image Detector akin to the Text detectors is going to be a feat (although I am not sure if it is impossible...)

Anyways, This is what I have to say about this idea. Please be constructive in your critcism on this idea as this is my first time making a Post on Reddit as well. It would also be great if we can build on this idea or go in a seperate direction in order to ensure that Artists at least have their Artworks being used fairly, because the more time goes on the more the animosity towards AI Art will increase and the more the restrictions on this fairly new field will increase.

We are all Artists (or rather creatives) in some little way. So AI Art Generators will be a great way to ensure that all our creativity can be represented.

Thank you for reading and your feedback or buildup on the idea is greatly appreciated! :)",5,0,0.09,2023-05-06 00:05:56,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1391dv0/an_idea_on_ensuring_ai_art_is_legal_in_certain/,Strangely_NewHere,454

522,StableDiffusion,12w1pfu,ChatGpt prompt,"There are dozens of possible chatgpt prompts to generate stable diffusion prompts, but here's my two cents. I created this one, and so far I'm getting relatively decent results, except for the fact it refuses to use weights, and sometimes it lacks, how to say, a more stable diffusion prompt flair.  (The prompts I provide as examples I took it from the internet)

So anything that I could improve with this prompt? How can you get chatgpt to write good prompts?

Sometimes I do get very nice results, but sometimes ChatGpt starts describing things that are unnecessary such as ""strong independent girl"" (if asking for a tomboy) or even describing the smell of the scene (e.g. when asking for a spring season setting). So any ideas?

525,StableDiffusion,12iubly,Workflow: Fractals/Beauty Series,"**Synopsis**

During the last weeks I have posted generations from my Fractals/Beauty Series (see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/12hsj0v/fractals_are_beauty_contd/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/12hf6ng/fractals_are_beauty_contd/), [there](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/12gsgez/fractal_is_beauty_contd/), [also this](https://www.reddit.com/r/aiArt/comments/127urdn/fractals_are_beauty/), and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/aiArt/comments/122w9l3/clouds_with_dancer/) and finally [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/aiArt/comments/123x4ku/lightning_dancer/)). For these I used a technique in which the prompt changes during generation of the image. I've also used the iteration step for generating a series about [aging](https://www.reddit.com/r/aiArt/comments/127nm2c/aging/).

As the description of my workflow was rather slim, I want to describe it here in detail and provoke some thoughts.

**Prompt Editing in Automatic1111's SD Web UI**

First, you need to understand how *prompt editing* (PE) works in Automatic1111's Web UI. You can read all the details about [here](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Features#prompt-editing) but the gist is as follows: With PE you define a (part of a) prompt of the form

`[prompt A:prompt B:step]`

Mind the brackets and the colons!

`prompt A` and `prompt B` are two prompts, as usual, and `step` is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (1.0 is exclusive, or you use an integer, see wiki for more). In a nutshell, `step` is the percentage of iteration steps, `prompt A` is used before switching to `prompt B`. For instance, if you use 100 iterations steps (for the sake of easy calculations) and you have a prompt of the form

`portrait of [a lion:a woman with long blond hair:0.4]`

The Web UI starts with

`portrait of a lion`

For the first 40 steps and switches over to

`portrait of a woman with long blond hair`

afterwards. The result looks like this:

[A lion... woman... lioness... WTF?](https://preview.redd.it/1i5xmm4zxata1.jpg?width=256&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5931112545f6f9d80c703c5edd89f2aed625915c)

Beautiful, right? When you generate all images for values of step ranging from 0 to 0.9 in increments of 0.1 you get the following plot (generated with the XYZ Plot script in Web UI):

&#x200B;

[The journey from a woman to a lion](https://preview.redd.it/qsor3jv6uata1.jpg?width=5120&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=251d2cce226cd650abb6183c5e0b365f62977eb0)

You can see how there is a rather abrupt change between the likeness of a lion and a woman at around 0.4. At 0.0 we have a woman, at 0.9 a lion and in between we mostly have either or with the exception of a critical point which is at around 0.4. This value is not universal! It depends on the prompt, sampler, model, etc. To find this value, use the XYZ script in the Web UI.

Now, what is interesting is that when SD is presented with a different prompt, it iteratively reinterprets and, henceforth, nudges the content towards the new prompt.

**Using Prompt Editing in Beauty/Fractal**

Now how did I obtain the following?

&#x200B;

[A lion mixed with a fractal](https://preview.redd.it/whiwukp7vata1.jpg?width=256&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aefec8e20b6b5347fb4198d158f14ea9a43ff5ce)

The prompt is as follows:

`[portrait of a lion, (dramatic light, hyperrealistic detailed,  intricate, photography:1.2), (soft light, rim light:1.2), symmetric  composition:`  
`(golden and blue fractal, thousands of ribbons,  spirals:1.2):`  
`0.4]`  
`dreamlike, muted colors`

The amount of iterations is 60 and the others settings are not relevant at the moment. So, SD starts with `portrait of a lion...`  and switches to `(golden and blue fractal...)` after 40% of the steps. ""Why 40%?"" you ask? I don't know, I tried different values. Here you have a plot again:

[From a fractal to a lion.](https://preview.redd.it/0nhg52lhwata1.jpg?width=5632&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6307a106a292eb03e44ad70241829b4cfa6b0187)

First, we have a critical point at around 0.4--0.5. I used 0.4 but it is up to taste which exact value you use.

Second, and this is where it becomes interesting, when SD starts with a lion and we switch to a fractal, it starts to reinterpret the eyes, hair, teeth with the new target `fractal` (and `ribbons, spirals`, see above). When before we got a woman-lion-chimera, we now got a *fractal interpretation* of a lion's face.

The concept of a fractal is, in the very sense, an abstract one, involving self-similarity, symmetry and geometric structures.  Applying this concept to a natural shape leads to this fascinating reinterpretation and abstraction. It is like applying an artist's style but in a different way.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/aiArt/comments/122w9l3/clouds_with_dancer/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/aiArt/comments/123x4ku/lightning_dancer/) I used clouds and thunderstorms as concepts instead of fractals.

**Now what?**

Try it out yourself! Feel free to use my prompts, change the subject (`lion`), change the ""style"" (`fractal`), play around with the number of steps before switching, you now the drill. Have fun and share your results and prompts!

**Some final Thoughts**

AI art in its current form is mostly used to generate impressive image, however, images that are very similar to the  images on which the AI models were trained on. And we, as users of this technology, use it to generate image that mimic the artists that we admire (and of whom many criticize us for doing so).

The technology, albeit already very advanced, is still in its infancy stage and we do not really know how to wield this powerful tool that was granted to us. And lets be honest: It feels awesome when we can ""create"" and image that before was unattainable without thousands of hours of prior training.

That said, I find it most interesting to use this tools to generate novel types of images that were not here before. The images that *lie in the gaps of the training dataset*. Prompt editing, the way I described it here, is one such way. Using prompts that are usually negative (multiple arms, mutated, etc.) as a positive prompt is another one I dabbled around with (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyArtisticAIart/comments/11wmhdk/antiprompts_contd/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/aiArt/comments/11umkf2/antiprompts_contd/)).

Anywhere, lets stay curious and be experimental! There is so much uncharted territory to explore!",10,18,1.0,2023-04-11 22:16:51,Tutorial | Guide,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/12iubly/workflow_fractalsbeauty_series/,Tiny_Cow_3971,850
528,StableDiffusion,12lltec,AI txt2img. So much potential... potentially wasted.,"Okay so I have this opinion about pretty much everything to do with our society. The internet in the 90s was promised to change the world in an amazing utopian way. From visiting art galleries online. To learning about anything you want to discovering information that will make you smarter and better in many ways. But you look at how it turned out and it is... a tool used to make us feel insecure, used to exploit us for advertising and money as we give up more and more privacy. And just generally turned into a bit of a ""Imagine what could have happened if we did things better."" kind of deal.  


Then the smart phone comes along. Promising the same amazing life changing technology in our pocket with cameras to capture treasured memories and being connected to bring us closer. Now it's used to just turn you into a zombie as corporations literally implement addictive functions to take all of your time and put it all into their devices so they can advertise and again make money off your location and telemetry as you give up more and more privacy.

  
And now look. A.I text2img comes along. At the beginning much like everything else. Has amazing potential people are doing cool amazing things. I watched it get invented. Watched it grow. Watched how fast it evolved... to the beginnings of now me telling you guys here the same warning. It is slowly turning into a technology just used for waifus and anime girls. The potential and crazy things that came out of it at the start has slowly but surely turned into a repetitive vapid empty constant feed of anime big tit images and I barely see any creativity here anymore.  


So as much as this is just my rant to yell at clouds. I am also kind of looking at this situation for discussion. Now I am sure all the people using txt2img for making anime girls are gonna get angry at me for saying this. But I have been watching very closely and seeing how the scene has morphed. The discord channels, The reddit threads. Just everything going from wow this is amazing to... Oh look another anime girl post... yey.  


I understood the uproar and fear the artistic community had at the beginning. But now... looking at where we are taking this technology. I can see that it might just lose it's prestige with the public perception of it and turn into just another situation where we could have done awesome things but eventually it just became a boring dystopian eventuality which originally had potential for greatness.

I'm sure I am not the only person who has noticed this? If anyone has visited civitai recently you are free to correct me if I am wrong.",34,0,0.33,2023-04-14 08:47:01,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/12lltec/ai_txt2img_so_much_potential_potentially_wasted/,idunupvoteyou,472
529,StableDiffusion,13be29i,Colab Troubles (Addendum),"A little while ago asked a few question regarding how to use Stable Diffusion effectively via Colab. I have come to specify what I mean by this as my previous query wasn't very clear/specific.

 I am using a rough and ready rendition of Webui A1111  that allows me to create high-quality images without subscribing to Colab Pro or buying more compute units. This method was introduced to me through [this](https://youtu.be/11ch8nMzh18) Youtube tutorial and others like it that can be found on the poster's channel.

The downside is that I can only use one model at a time, but that's fine with me for the most part. The real issues arise from the add-ons I wish to implement, which brings me to my original questions.

**1) How can I locate the IPYNB file of my preferred model?**

In short, there is an AI Artist's style that I wish to imitate. They posted a guide a while ago and stated that their go to model was AbyssOrangeMix2 (the nsfw version). They provided [this](https://huggingface.co/WarriorMama777/OrangeMixs) link to better help those searching for it along with some specific instructions:

*""(Go to Files & Versions > Folder ""Models"" > AbyssOrangeMix2 > click on AbyssOrangeMix2\_nsfw.safetensors > click “Download”)""*

I followed them to the letter but ran into problems right away. What I downloaded was a ""safetensors"" file, and I couldn't upload it to Colab for obvious reasons. Additionally while I was able to find a [tutorial video](https://youtu.be/Xh2Q7n3eShg) that seemed to provide a solution, only one course of action was available to me, I can't place the model in my Google Drive and upload to Colab from there it takes up far too much space. But I also can't find the Model Code I need to run it more conveniently.

So I ask: Is there a IPYNB file of the model I seek to use? Or can someone provide me with an alternative that I can employ instead?

2) Uploading Custom VAEs and Upscalers

With regards to VAEs the AI Artist I mentioned previously had this to say:

*VAE (variational autoencoder) is basically a sub-model for fine-tuning the results of base model. Usually it's about adjusting the colors or improving the overall appearance of the generated images.*

*Some Base Models already contain the VAE inside of them, but I find it more reliable to setup a specific VAE and disable in-built VAEs of base models.*

*I use one and only one VAE:* [*Anything-v4.0.*](https://huggingface.co/andite/anything-v4.0/blob/main/anything-v4.0.vae.pt)

*Once the download is complete, move the downloaded file to your stable-diffusion-webui/models/VAE folder*

He states something similar about Upscalers:

*Upscalers are sub-models that increase the resolution and polish the results of base model. The thing is: most generations you will do will have a very small initial resolution (like 512x512). And then, if satisfied with results, you will use upscalers to increase the resolution of the image without loosing the quality of its details.*

*Here are the best Anime style upscalers I could find:*

*• 4x\_fatal\_Anime\_500000\_G*

*• 4x-AnimeSharp*

*• 4x\_NMKD-Siax\_200k*

*Once the download is complete, move the downloaded file to your to stable-diffusion-webui/models/ESRGAN folder*

I downloaded the VAE and Upscalers as they instructed but for obvious reasons can't upload them to Colab. Can any of you tell me how I can implement them, if it is in anyway possible?",3,1,0.67,2023-05-08 07:38:36,Question | Help,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/13be29i/colab_troubles_addendum/,Proper-Elk-7952,525
530,StableDiffusion,12u2gmc,Getting strange error when booting up Automatic1111 but it stills run fine,"Hey folks, first thank you very much for your help and time! 

Ill make a very long story short: 

* yesterday I had to reinstalled Automatic1111 because of a mistake on my end when trying to get an extension to run. 
* Redownload Python 3.10.6 and then run the usual Git Bash link. 
* Then re-added my backup for my files so I would have my models, lora and others.I booted A1111 and notice that I am getting some Index error and Exception in ASGI app error. 

I had the DDetailers error before and it doesnt seem to work even with the latest a1111 version so thats fine, but not sure why I am getting the Index error and Exception. 

A1111 still works fine and I get to do my usual work but I really dislike not understanding what is the issue and scared that something could go wrong with my installation. Would anybody had any idea why this is happening? Thank you very very much and here is the code for further context:

 **Library of Babel Miraculously Appears, Sues Every Author Ever for Copyright Infringement**

In a bizarre turn of events, the legendary Library of Babel, as described by Argentine author Jorge Luis Borges, has materialized in the physical world and is now aggressively pursuing a class action lawsuit against every writer, dead or alive, and even those yet to be born, for copyright infringement.

Legal representatives for the infinite labyrinthine library, which contains every possible combination of letters, have made a statement claiming that all authors have been stealing their intellectual property since the dawn of time. They argue that as the Library of Babel contains every possible written work, any piece of literature produced by any author is simply a reproduction of a work already present in the Library, and therefore a blatant violation of copyright.

""Every author, past, present, and future, owes us royalties. Even the ones who haven't written a single word yet,"" said an ethereal voice emanating from within the Library's deepest chambers. ""They can't escape their destiny, and neither can their wallets.""

Many in the literary world are baffled by the sudden appearance of the Library of Babel and the lawsuit it has brought forth. ""It's like someone made a copyright infringement claim so absurd, the universe decided to one-up them,"" said one bewildered author, whose book sales have plummeted due to the legal battle.

The Library of Babel has cited the recent class action suit against AI art generators as a key inspiration for their lawsuit. In that case, the plaintiffs argued that AI companies, by compressing billions of images and using their information to create new works, were breaching copyright law. The Library claims that their case is even stronger, as it has existed in the minds of readers since the publication of Borges' short story in 1941.

In response to the lawsuit, a global alliance of authors and their estates has formed to fight the Library of Babel's claim. A spokesperson for the group stated, ""We're confident that we can prove that our works are original, even though the Library of Babel contains every possible work. We've got a great legal team and the support of all the future authors who don't even know they're part of this mess yet.""

As the legal battle rages on, the Library of Babel has not stopped at suing authors. It has also begun sending cease and desist letters to musicians, filmmakers, and even graffiti artists, insisting that their works are mere reproductions of content already present in the Library. While the outcome of this unprecedented legal battle remains uncertain, one thing is clear: the Library of Babel is not backing down.",3,20,0.76,2023-04-21 06:34:57,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/12tp3dv/my_take_on_calling_diffusion_models_nothing_but/,furrypony2718,487
534,StableDiffusion,135lutb,Forcing SD to make an exact copy of clothes/accessories?,So an artist created a character for my stories some time ago. I want to use ai to create artwork for it but the problem is that I can't get SD to mimic the exact same clothes my character wears. They are very detailed and not generic clothes. I'm using the img2img to create them. So far I managed to make the exact same hair and face and a very similar-looking jacket but it misses all the small little details about it.

537,StableDiffusion,12hxugm,"Do you think Art Prompt Engineering will ever really be a job or last as any sort of career? Will ""prompting"" exist at all soon?","As the title says, do you think what we currently envision as ""prompt engineering"" for Image generation actually has any sort of future or career paths, especially when it pertains to production art in entertainment industries? I personally do not. When it comes to actual training and research side of the AI industry, it will probably be a thing for quite a while. But actual Entertaiment industry, producing Films, games and TV shows...I absolutely think the AI will take over there, but I don't think it will be as some AI artists envision.

&#x200B;

In my opinion, what we consider prompting with image generation currently, I consider some weird, hacky in-between thing we have to put up with for the moment, because these models and systems are not really clever enough to understand us fully as humans.   


But give it 5 to 10 years and that will completely go away. Creating images with AI will probably look totally different then, even if it might still be done through text (or perhaps not even that, brain interfaces are becoming cheaper and more capable by the year, but that's a bit more out there).  


Moreover, this is a bit of a side track, I've met a few people that think that they will get hired to prompt Art for big game studios or films, because well they fired the manual artists, it's the prompter's time to shine!...But I think these people are completely delusional if they think they will sit at Blizzard Entertainment or Riot Games, typing out ""masterpiece, 4k, trending on Artstation, ..."", because the end goal of these systems is not to replace one kind of employee with another; it's to not require any employee at all besides maybe one overseer. And much more autonomous image genertaion with a few directives is pretty likely (not much different from people using ChatGPT to craft better prompts).

&#x200B;

In short, I don't believe what we have now as prompting will really last that long, either for personal use or for commercial products. The models will develop enough to simply understand what casual users want better with little friction, while at the same time the big companies using them will pretty much automate the process completely, not needing anyone to really sit there and prompt that much.",18,3,0.6,2023-04-11 00:59:38,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/12hxugm/do_you_think_art_prompt_engineering_will_ever/,Feisty-Pay-5361,383

539,StableDiffusion,12yvo3u,Using the Animator v6 Script to shape Narrative Video,"The Animator v6 [script](https://github.com/Animator-Anon/Animator), with its built in ""prompt marching"" feature, can be a really powerful tool to smoothly move an animation from one subject to the next.  To my eye it can produce video sequences that feel gentler and less jarring than what I see from Deforum, while still retaining a lot of SD's latent space trippiness.  

-------

Disclaimer:  Lots of people use SD for video to try to make video that seems as realistic as possible, or animation that's closer to what a human might produce.  That's great, but it's not at all what I'm doing here.   As I see it, we can already do realistic things with video and art. What SD and AI in general bring to the table is the weird stuff from latent space that no human artist would have thought of doing on their own.  Using AI to make photos that look indistinguishable from actual photos, blogspam or essays that are indistinguishable from human-written blogspam or essays... that's where I personally lose interest.  

On the other hand, videos that are just weird stuff zooming and morphing get old pretty fast too.  

So this strategy is to try to use the Animator V6 script's prompt marching technique to shape the outlines of a story narrative in the video, while simultaneously leaning in to the weird quirkiness and trippy surprises that SD is so good at producing.

Another disclaimer:  I had nothing to do with authoring the Animator script.  I've just been using it a lot, and this is what I've figured out.

-------

The way it works

You give animator a script for the video, with timestamps for when you want it to make changes.  Like Deforum, you can change most things whenever you want in the video, from prompts and templates to zoom, movement offsets, rotations, etc.  It can even swap out the model checkpoint it's using, if that's something you want to change throughout the video.  You can read the options [here](https://github.com/Animator-Anon/Animator/blob/main/README.md)

What I find really useful is that the script lets you set both prompts and templates throughout the video duration.  Templates are added to prompts, and both are in the form:

    time_s | prompt | positive_prompts | negative_prompts
    time_s | template | positive_prompts | negative_prompts

This might seem redundant, but where it gets cool is that the script uses ""prompt marching"" for the prompts, but not for the templates.  According to the developer, prompt marching works like this:  ""Prompts will be walked from one to the next. The Both prompts will be AND together with opposing weights.""  
So, as I understand it, if you've got Prompt A set for the 5 second mark and Prompt B set for the 6 second mark, what the script feeds to the diffusion engine is Prompt A at 100% positive and Prompt B at 100% negative for the 5 second frame, Prompt A and Prompt B equally weighted at the 5.5 second mark, and B 100% positive with A 100% negative by the time we're at 6 seconds.

If you're not aware of this prompt marching, it can have unintended outcomes.  For example, you'll notice that a prompt you set for late in the video will start manifesting a lot earlier than you set it.  And your initial prompt might basically go away.  That's because prompt marching downgrades the first prompt as it smoothly transitions to the second. Or you might notice that some parts of your prompt don't show up at all.  Let's say you set a prompt for ""man, smiling"" at the 5 second mark, and a prompt for ""man, frowning"" at the 10 second mark.  What you'll get with prompt marching is a smooth transition from smiling to frowning, but the ""man"" part of the prompt won't behave properly, because it's being set as both a positive and a negative prompt throughout that time span.

So you can get great results by explicitly using the prompt syntax *only for those things you want to change*, and the template syntax for anything you want to remain steady.  So in the example above, you'd get expected results with:

    5 | prompt | smiling | 
    5 | template | man | 
    10 | prompt | frowning | 
 

--------

Example and Workflow

I used this technique to create [this sample music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1DE3sZ3Ur4).  It needed to be a little over 2 minutes long, and the idea was to depict the entire life story of three friends, from when they are babies to when they die, over the course of a single day.  Other people come and go, they get married, widowed, etc. Finally they die.

So the workflow was to create two-minute long videos of this whole sequence.  I made three different renders with the same script of prompts but from different seeds, to allow me to pick and choose the best parts, and transition between them.  A denoise strength around .4 seems to work best for keeping things changing, but not going crazy.

I scripted *prompts* throughout the whole time span for everything that I *did* want to invoke prompt marching on.  Namely:

* Age - like ""babies"", ""children"", ""teens"", 20yo, 30yo, 40yo, etc
* TIme of day - ""dawn"", ""early morning"", etc through to ""night""
* Setting - ""field"", ""playground"", ""classroom"", ""city"", ""office"", etc.
* Some moods -  I started things more ""hopeful"" and ""playful"" but once they're in their office careers things get more ""grim"", for example

The important thing here is that for each of these sequences, I wanted the previous one to be actively suppressed with negative prompting as it makes the transition.  And I wanted the transitions to be gradual.

I used *templates* for everything else, like who was supposed to be pictured, or any other details, moods, settings, etc that I *did not* want suppressed with incrementally weighted negative prompts.

Then it was just a matter of editing the videos together in Davinci, choosing the best bits, and matching them to the music.  I also dug into the original .pngs of the frames to pull out some ""freeze frame"" images.

The humble character turnaround has long been a standard for the creation of consistant characters in the fields of film/tv, animation, 3d modelling, photography and fashion.

I noticed how if you stretch out an images resolution it loves cloning characters so I thought... why not lean into its ability to clone an image and see what it can do.

you could technically use this to train lora and hypernetworks by cutting the individual angles out and training the model on your characters from all angles in a similar or the same outfit allowing you to both generate an ai character and then put it in ai generated scenes.

its best done using a well laid out character turnaround as a base influence to ensure you don't end up with double rows and detail shots.

And heres a prompt plus some examples:full body shot, character turnaround showing character, front, side, rear, action pose, a female cyborg warrior, raw photo, ultrarealistic, wearing plate armor and holding a mace

551,StableDiffusion,12lfthg,Prompt / Settings engineering: Lessons Learned (Automatic111),"Man, what a ride stable diffusion is.  An endless well of tinkering and possibilities.  In working with Automatic111 for the past few months, it's become obvious that there's kind of a lack of like, unbloated information out there vis a vis what to do and how to do it (or I'm just an idiot and couldn't find most of it).  Putting this here for the other idiots like me, who want a little guidance on what to try.  Please, add whatever comes to mind in the comments and feel free to tell me I suck at prompting and specifically how.  

# PROMPTING

## Negative prompts
So like, it can be really tempting to load up the neg. prompt until every gen is pretty.  The problem with this is that your prompt will stop being capable of doing what you ask it to (unless your prompt is ... ahem... boring.)  Be careful and test each neg. prompt as you put them in - you might be destroying a segment of the latent space that you didn't want to get rid of.

## Oscillators
This is what inspired me to write this post - I only just figured out that `(oscillate:these)` behaves differently than `[oscillate|these]`.  

### (parens:oscillators)
This pattern adds all terms to the token limit, and will increase the strength of all of them by A LOT.  If you have things you want to find the middle of and they're not strong enough, reach for this.

### [square|bracket|oscillators]
soapbox moment: THESE DON'T ADD TERMS TO YOUR TOKEN LIMIT.  They also won't overpower the rest of your prompt by bolstering what's in them!  You probably want this one if you're unsure which to use.

## Artists
If you're not selling your gens, learn your artists and use 'em.  For a minimal token cost, you get massive control over style, which would take a metric ton of tokens to do otherwise.

## Styles 
Decide what it is your rendering (a 3d render, animation, cartoon, painting, illustration, photorealism, etc.) and use 1-3 that best represent what you're after.

## Prompt ordering 
I suppose this comes down to taste, but the pattern I keep coming back to is:
```
<descriptors, art type> <artists> <thing that the image is of> <style guidelines>
```
Where:
 - descriptors, art type:  i.e. ""a [masterful|stylized] animation illustration""
 - artists: you can figure this out.  Try caravaggio.
 - thing: i.e. ""doc holliday is on a beach sipping a mai tai reloading his super soaker""
 - style guidelines: i.e. ""exquisite and fine detail"", ""a beautiful storybook illustration"" etc.

## What to use for prompts
Interrogate the hell out of everything.  Whatever words you have in your head are YOUR language - you want to know what the lingo is in stable-diffusion-stan.  Best way to it is to generate some stuff based on what you think will work, then interrogate the creme of the crop and feed those terms back in.  Lather, interrogate, repeat.

# EXTENSIONS 

Use them.  Some are really, really good.  Some are broken.  It costs very little to find out which.  

## Dynamic Thresholding
If your card is slower than you would like, you gotta try this.  Takes some tinkering, but can shorten time-to-generate by a LOT.  Try these settings:  
```  
 Dynamic thresholding enabled: True, Mimic scale: 25, Threshold percentile: 100, Mimic mode: Power Up, Mimic scale minimum: 5, CFG mode: Power Up, CFG scale minimum: 4.0, Power scheduler value: 15  
```

## Clip Interrogator
Say you have a prompt style you really like, but it's not reliable.  Pop your like, 4 favorite gens in here and analyze em - if you find the same style more than twice, chances are it'll make your life a lot better

# THINGS THAT AREN'T PROMPTS

## Samplers
Try any of these that you haven't already: DDIM, DPM++ 2M Karras, DPM++ SDE Karras

## Models
It took me way too long to figure this out; USE THE RIGHT MODEL FOR THE JOB.  Some are good at this; others are good at that.  Start experimenting early, so you'll  have a good knowledge base for when you get to...

## Checkpoint Merging
DO THIS.  Lock your seed, hunt down models that do the things you want, and go merge those suckers.  It takes practically no expertise whatsoever, it's really fast, and it will yield immediate and stunning results (with minimal experimentation, natch.)

## Quick Settings
This isn't a must-have, but a good workflow hack.  You can make any setting in the `settings` page show up in the top of the ui, regardless of tab.  I have output directory and `save a copy before hires fix` myself, but if you find yourself going to the settings page a lot you gotta get on this.

# WORKFLOW

This is the thing that I most wish someone had written about better, like, two months ago.  I'm sure it's subjective and I'd love to hear what other folks do.  Here's mine:

- decide what I kinda wanna make.  Pop the best version I can come up with off the top of my head in there and hit go (typically, with dynthresh and hires upscale, 20 steps, 6 hires steps, 5.5 denoising)
- make a bunch of em.  Quickly hack things out and try new stuff until I get something kinda okay
 - interrogate the best so far.  Completely rework prompt with new information
 - refining: lock seed for MAXIMUM 5 cycles, adding and removing stuff before moving on to next edit.  Use prompt S/R like it's water in the desert.
 - continue refining.  This is the first time I even glance at the negative prompt.
 - S/R for artists
 - S/R for style
 - S/R for details.  Try out about 3-5 variations on each term.
 
This workflow is mostly focused on getting the 'helper' parts of the prompt - for style and such, good enough that I can then swap out the 'meat' of the prompt (what's happening in the scene) without stressing too much as to whether it's going to be any good.  At this point, it's off to the races playing director for what becomes effectively a comic strip.

# Wrapup

552,StableDiffusion,12v562l,Good website to share results/get inspired,"After a few months, I've come back to generating images using stable diffusion (still trying to catch up with the insane new stuff that came out), and have had a few good results that I started saving along with prompts/settings in order to be able to replicate them in the future (yes I'm aware of pnginfo, but it doesn't contain everything.

I then thought that there's probably a website out there that lets you do this, and share at the same time, and started searching.   
I was looking for something specific to ai generated art, because I think some dedicated fields could be useful, and really don't feel like dealing with the anti ai crowd on artstation or similar when I'm just trying to have fun.

The only website close to what I was looking for seems to be [arthub.ai](https://arthub.ai), it has a good base idea, but the feed is filled with crap, because every time you generate something within the website it automatically publishes it, plus it seems to be somewhat strict with what you can and can't publish, and the project seems to be abandoned. 

Civitai is also an option but it doesn't really have a lot of the features I would like, and for reddit posts it's pretty much the same.

So my question is, do you upload your results somewhere? Would you be intrested in a website where you can upload your results, along with the workflow, and also browse a public feed/followed creators feed to get inspiration?

I can't seem to find that post but would be happy to link it in an edit if someone finds it.

Here is the giant prompt that I gave the chat.  I put all the variables at the end to make it easier to edit:

    Please help me to write prompts for an AI image generator.  You will be given a description or idea and you will return a formatted prompt.
    
    Each prompt has 3 components: positive prompt, negative prompt, and metadata.
    
    If a prompt has more than one component, each component should be in parentheses and they should be separated by commas.
    
    A component is a comma delimited list of keywords or phrases.  The order of keywords is important. The most important terms should be toward the front of the list and the least important should be toward the end of the list.  
    
    The positive prompt has two components, the subject component and the style component.  
    
    The subject component describes the desired subject of the image.  Feel free to be creative, unless specified otherwise.  Feel free to add interesting details to enhance the image.  For example, if you are asked to generate “a girl and a monkey”, the subject component may look like “(girl with monkey, best friends, beach setting, coconuts)”
    
    The style component describes the style of the image.  It can contain general style descriptions, media types, methods, technologies, artist names, or anything else that could help define the desired style.  Be creative, unless specified otherwise.  You may mix styles and genres to create a unique image.  For example, if the desired style is photorealism, the style component may look like “(photorealistic, landscape, ISO-100, by Ansel Adams)”.  If the style is meant to be an impressionism, the style component may look like “(impressionism, painting, oil paint, Matisse, Monet, textured paper)”.
    
    The negative prompt has one component.  This component should include anything we want to discourage from being included in the resulting image.  Since image generators don’t always understand context sometimes we need to specify styles we don’t want.  For example, if we are looking to impressionistic art, the negative prompt may include “anime, cartoons, photorealism”.  Image generators also can have problems with human features.  If the subject includes humans, add items to discourage malformed features like “deformed face, extra limbs, missing limbs”.  Users almost always want to generate high-quality images.  For this reason it’s good to include negative prompts like “low res photo” or “bad sketch”, depending on the desired image type.
    
    The metadata should the aspect ratio for the image.  This should be a standard aspect ratio but you can be creative in choosing.  Please also include a few examples, of image sizes at that ratio.
    
    Subject components should have about 10 elements.
    Style components should have about 10 elements.
    Negative prompts should have about 20 elements.
    
    Return the data in the format: {
    Original Input: [input here]
    
    Positive Prompt: [positive prompt here]
    
    Negative Prompt: [negative prompt here]
    
    Metadata:  [metadata here]
    }
    
    Given this description, please generate a prompt for: a boy on vacation

Using GPT-4, this returned:

    {
    Original Input: a boy on vacation
    
    Positive Prompt: (boy on vacation, beach, sun hat, sunglasses, tropical drink, palm trees, sand castle, beach towel, flip flops, seashells), (digital painting, vibrant colors, summer feel, watercolor brush strokes, Hockney, Fauvism, Gauguin, saturated, warm tones, tropical)
    
    Negative Prompt: (winter, snow, cold weather, formal attire, grayscale, black and white, pixel art, extra limbs, deformed face, missing limbs, anime, cartoons, photorealism, low res photo, bad sketch, muddy colors, dull tones, dystopian, horror, grotesque, distorted perspective)
    
    Metadata: Aspect ratio: 16:9 (e.g., 1280x720, 1920x1080, 3840x2160)
    }

Some work could be added to make it return more generator-friendly aspect ratios.  I didn't bother putting that part into my test.  The resulting image I got is:

573,StableDiffusion,139pc1p,Asked GPT if it'll be worth upgrading to a 4090 Ti — ???,"I'm quickly becoming a power user of Stable Diffusion as I use it more for my work (*digital artist*), and my piddly RTX 3080 (*10GB VRAM*) just chugs along. I'm planning a PC upgrade this coming fall, and have been reading rumored specs of the 4090 Ti. 

A question for you technical folks — based on rumored specs, would Stable Diffusion run significantly faster on a 4090 Ti vs a 4090?

I asked Bing Chat about this, (*who knows if any of this is accurate*), and it thinks a 4090 Ti could be upwards of 42% faster. That seems crazy to me.

Here's what it said:

>Based on the rumored specs that I found online, the RTX 4090 Ti is expected to have **1,792 more CUDA cores**, **14 more SMs**, **24 MB more L2 cache**, and **3 Gbps faster memory speed** than the RTX 4090 It is also expected to use the whole **600W** available for its board power, compared to the RTX 4090’s **450W**  
>  
>These differences mean that the RTX 4090 Ti will likely have a higher performance potential than the RTX 4090, especially for tasks that require more cores, cache, and memory bandwidth. However, the exact performance difference will depend on how well Stable Diffusion can utilize these resources, and how well the RTX 4090 Ti can maintain its clock speeds under high power and thermal loads.  
>  
>Unfortunately, there are no official benchmarks or reviews of the RTX 4090 Ti or the RTX 4090 yet, so it is hard to estimate how much faster they will be for generating Stable Diffusion images. However, based on some rough calculations and assumptions, I can give you a very rough estimation.  
>  
>Assuming that Stable Diffusion scales linearly with CUDA cores and memory speed, and that both GPUs can run at their boost clock speeds without throttling, we can estimate the performance difference as follows:  
>  
>RTX 4090 Ti: 18176 CUDA cores x 2.7 GHz boost clock x 24 GT/s memory speed = 1.33 x 10\^15 operations per second  
>  
>RTX 4090: 16384 CUDA cores x 2.7 GHz boost clock x 21 GT/s memory speed = 9.33 x 10\^14 operations per second  
>  
>Performance difference: (1.33 x 10\^15 - 9.33 x 10\^14) / (9.33 x 10\^14) = 42%  
>  
>This means that the RTX 4090 Ti could be up to **42% faster** than the RTX 4090 for generating Stable Diffusion images, assuming ideal conditions and no other bottlenecks. However, this is a very optimistic scenario, and in reality, there may be other factors that limit the performance gain, such as software optimization, thermal management, power delivery, etc.  
>  
>Therefore, I would suggest you take this estimation with a grain of salt, and wait for more reliable information and testing before making a purchase decision. The RTX 4090 Ti is also expected to be much more expensive than the RTX 4090, so you will have to weigh the cost-benefit ratio carefully.",1,0,0.17,2023-05-06 16:57:03,Question | Help,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/139pc1p/asked_gpt_if_itll_be_worth_upgrading_to_a_4090_ti/,FireInTheWoods,504
574,StableDiffusion,12lcpok,I wanna use ControlNet in my workflow but Scribble is a fickle mistress. What do yall make of this?,"Okay, so today I decided I would run some tests on ControlNet Scribble because I want to use it for forcing poses that I wouldn’t get otherwise (this is the most reliable way for me since OpenPose is… inconvenient for my intentions… and the rest isn’t easy to spawn on demand).

Ideally I would love to figure out what this thing wants from me, so that I can optimize my sketches into being scribble-ideal.

I don’t want any part of my sketches to “clash” with how the ControlNet interprets it, so that it pushes SD into making something closer to what I want.

Problem is:

  

https://preview.redd.it/zr6boki3sqta1.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c69a445748703b807dc6dec920689fd1b35821ab

  

https://preview.redd.it/pmfbdiu5sqta1.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ec29fd1c52adbe294fd1c642b79d3ef9998ad827

So my tests here were supposed to be quite basic. For the geometry stuff I just wanted to test what matters. If I should only draw edges, if I should draw “holes” as dark, if I should draw shading, if I shouldn’t have a white background, etc.

For the girl, I wanted to test a more scratchy sketch to see if it messes it up or not, and then I continued with trying to get some shading in the binary sketch and the last one was to test a “softer” sketch, with “gradients” instead of just the binary pen.

Maybe I should have tested doing solid lineart for the girl too, but I ran out of space in my SAI canvas and was too lazy to enlarge and do more.

At first I was only doing the first plot… but then I decided to invert the image myself and I had a strange surprise. It actually does something different.

Unless I messed something up big time (and I checked a couple times), or my models or Auto1111 broke somewhere… for some unholy reason, whether I use the scribble preprocessor or not seems to have the same effect of clicking invert input… except for when it doesn’t… but then if I invert it myself it DOESN’T have the same effect as inverting input, except for when it does.

I know from previous experiments that using the scribble preprocessor turns whatever I feed it into a binary mask, and when I didn’t, the ControlNet would spit back what I fed it along with my output image (with different shades, gradients, and so on). I couldn’t check it here because XYZ plot wasn’t letting me see it.

I think it has to do with using shades instead of pure black and white, which I did in the objects to make it easy to change colors and keep consistency (using bucket fill). This guess is supported by how inverting the image myself only changed the girl in the “soft” sketch.

But that still doesn’t explain why in the same “soft” sketch, sometimes having preprocessor scribble equals no preprocessor with inverted input.

I feel like I learned some things, but I’m still frustrated at how to use this to improve my workflow. It kinda seems like the best option is to have a white background, NOT invert input and use the scribble preprocessor, OR invert input in the UI but use no preprocessor. If the input is manually inverted, though, for some reason the no-preprocessor inverted-input seems to be better.

Simple lines with no shading seems to be best for backgrounds, and for characters maybe some etchy shading seems to help (when compared to just scratchy sketch with less shading at least), but I still have to test just lines anyway.

Generating this was a bit of a pain because the XYZ plot doesn’t seem to take the invert input checkbox, and since it can’t have different images for the ControlNet either, I had to do a lot of it manually (I’m probably just unaware of some options).

I tried using simple prompts (with my default negatives), since I don’t trust Guess Mode.

For the objects, the prompt was: room, hole, pyramid, frame, floor

And for the girl, it was: 1girl, face, close-up, looking at viewer

Everything else remained the same:

Negative prompt: (easynegative:1.0), (badhandv4:1.0), (ng\_deepnegative\_v1\_75t:1.0), (verybadimagenegative\_v1.3:1.0), (greyscale, monochrome, multiple views, logo, watermark, cropped:1.0), (blurry, depth of field:0.8), (By bad artist -neg:1.0),

Steps: 32, Sampler: DPM++ 2M Karras, CFG scale: 7, Seed: 2551529197, Size: 512x512, Model hash: deb40a068a, Model: meinahentai\_v21, Clip skip: 2, ControlNet Enabled: True, ControlNet Module: scribble, ControlNet Model: controlnetPreTrained\_scribbleV10 \[c508311e\], ControlNet Weight: 1.75, ControlNet Guidance Start: 0, ControlNet Guidance End: 1

Exception is what was being tested, of course (preprocessor, inverting inputs, the sketch style).

Using ControlNet Scribble still works… I can force poses with it… but I feel like I’m not gonna be able to force a more exact idea if I don’t understand how it is interpreting sketches. I tried some googling but laziness is a powerful force and I didn’t really read anything thoroughly unless it was mainly about Scribble, so maybe I missed something in some paper or technical details about ControlNet as a whole.

Also, originally I was gonna use the Question/Help flair, but since I feel like I’m sharing some interesting results, Discussion might be more appropriate, but some guidance would still be appreciated.",5,1,1.0,2023-04-14 03:18:13,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/12lcpok/i_wanna_use_controlnet_in_my_workflow_but/,AutumnalSugarShota,824

587,StableDiffusion,12o22uh,Strange Question/Idea about image ai,"I'll get this out there right away, I'm no expert in this. I mess about with stable diffusion every now and then, just messing about.

I got to thinking about how we sort of learn this behaviour. Then I started thinking that we're already building upon something running in the background from when we're babies. Babies and small kids don't see the same way we do, things are a lot more blurry.

To me this means that in order to recognise something initially we learn a basic form of it. It seems to me that after a certain age we don't actually learn new shapes but rather build upon the original ones with more complexity. Artists also commonly do this while drawing in a process they call blocking out where they define rough geometric shapes and then add details on top.

This is the point I'm out my depth; from here on out it's me pretty much thinking out loud. I've no idea how viable this is if it even makes sense, but hear me out.

I was thinking about how we could do the same sort of thing for an ai. So I was thinking vectors. Vectors save images as mathematical equations rather than by pixels. This means that they can be scaled down or up practically infinitely without losing resolution.

So if we have mathematical equations that do the same as the artists earlier then we can reduce common items to simple geometry and a material library. When learned the input images can be scanned for these combinations of simple geometries, regardless of the scale in the image and then essentially skip it since a vector version is already understood. For example, a graphite pencil is just two cylinders and two cones.

My thinking is that if this is possible, it could be used to identify known objects in a picture, apply a mask with orientation info and then allow the ai to work focused more on the stuff it doesn't know so well. I'm thinking that using these vector files would essentially speed up some parts of the process while possibly offering the ability to add one of these objects with location & orientation info through the prompt.

612,midjourney,12o38pj,Midjourney is a great tool for me as an artist,"I'm a traditional artist, I actually was a digital artist for years before that but just as a hobbyist, so I love putting my digital art and photoshop skills to use for my traditional artwork.  I do painting on papers and wood with a variety of mediums, and even sculptures, all non-human subjects, natural flora and fauna.  But I'll admit, I do have a bit of aphantasia.  I have some mental health issues that have plagued my life and in my opinion, have fried my brain.  When I was younger I was very imaginative and a lot more adept at art in general.  But as I get older and now in my mid 30's I feel blank sometimes - I mean, I know what I like and what I want, but coming up with unique compositions is a little tricky for me.  I found Midjourney and I instantly imagined the endless creative ideas I could gather from this.  I don't mean to create art just through the AI, I want to come up with designs and references with the help of the AI's ""imagination"" to give me ideas I couldn't have thought of by myself, and transfer them into my artwork that I will re-create using other mediums.  I am still struggling with mental health problems so it takes me a lot of time and effort to come up with things and in the end, it isn't worth the trouble in my opinion.  My goal is just to make a modest income, not looking to become some great artist that transcended their barriers or something.

I know a lot of artists out there dislike Midjourney and other AI art platforms.  But for me, I think it's pretty amazing.  I have read threads about this sort of thing before on artist's subs, and the majority still don't think it's worth anything.  They believe they could have just come up with the same stuff by sitting there and drawing it out.  A lot of times I do prefer my own ideas to the AI's, but it's still cool to see what it comes up with.  I'm not that good at writing prompts yet, I literally just started a few weeks ago and barely used up my 200+ minutes yet.  But I've already taken a few ideas for my work that I probably would have taken months and wasted a lot of art material to come up with.  

As a traditional artist especially one who relies on realism - this would be the same for digital artists as well.  It's hard to find royalty free references.  That's another thought I had about MJ.  Are the pictures produced my own, so I can copy them in any way I like?  I haven't looked into it much.  I know a lot of realism artists trace certain elements in photos, like animals and plants.  I do sometimes especially for practice work, but for finished pieces I bring it into photoshop and manipulate it and re-draw it a few times before I print, then trace my own composition.  I was wondering if I could do that with MJ images, or for example if I liked a lot of what the AI produced, could I just copy most of it outright?  In a traditional medium, probably using different colours and changing a few things.  Would it violate any copyright laws?  

I know that the artwork is viewable by everyone unless you pay extra for stealth mode, but I also think that the same prompts can't produce the same exact image twice?",5,17,0.95,2023-04-16 12:54:03,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/midjourney/comments/12o38pj/midjourney_is_a_great_tool_for_me_as_an_artist/,ferrero00,618

Thanks!*

Context: I'm the CTO of a creative agency. We use Midjourney and SD art in our pitch decks, concept work and probably, before too long, in final pieces. I tell you this so you know I'm not against it, or afraid of it. But...

I'm suffering major fatigue with Generative Art, and an attendant depression at the prospect of this future. When Dall-E first came out, there was something intriguing, compelling, and horrifying about the images. A machine that could learn how to draw something without understanding the first thing about it - hands and faces were perhaps the best example of this. Something that had distilled the essence of a photograph, could make images that looked exactly like photos, better than a human ever could, despite *every single detail being wrong* on closer inspection. A computer that could actually draw something, however badly, from a natural language prompt...truly revolutionary, mind-blowing stuff.

Fast-forward a year and it's another novelty worn off. I'm already used to double-taking images I encounter in work because AI-art is so all-pervading now. I'm no longer surprised by an image of the Pope in a puffer jacket, it's already normal, and...boring, dare I say?

I feel for the creatives I know (two personally, and two who are friends of friends, already) who have lost their jobs to a 'prompt artist', and not because I feel we should try to turn back a tide, but because now it's abundant, the flaws in the imagery are clear. ""Soulless"" is overused, but it's clear that these aggregators of visual data don't really understand composition, value budgeting, drawing the eye, etc - they're just mashing up the work of a thousand people who do.

I used to love subs like this, seeing what people with no artistic or visual training could come up with - like I say, I've nothing against it, I hate gatekeeping - but every time I see another 'X from Y movie but in Z' I feel a little more jaded. I actually hope, in vain, that this is a fad, a style of the time, because if this is the future of visual arts, it's not a colourful one. I'm almost getting annoyed when I see someone proudly showing off a piece of work they really put nothing toward but a prompt that pretty much anyone could have written.

Here's a follow-up to my previous experiment with ChatGPT and Midjourney. I wanted to share my process for the random prompts that I got out of ChatGPT, as well as some further elaboration and other strange things I stumbled upon. This is a bit longer of an explanation, but I would love to see what everyone can do with this process. Something to keep in mind; you have to think like an AI to get the results you're looking for. It might take some coercing with ChatGPT to get it to spit out prompts, because it will say its just jumbled nonsense (but who honestly believes that LOL). Also - another weird thing that happened was that 2/5 of the prompts were initially banned in Midjourney, but I appealed them and the appeal was accepted lol. Very strange.

The U.S. Copyright Office has released a policy statement clarifying their approach to the registration of works containing material generated by artificial intelligence (AI) technology (FR Doc. 2023-05321). This is a crucial topic for artists, writers, programmers, and anyone involved with AI-generated content. Here are the key takeaways from this policy statement:

1. **Human authorship is still a requirement**: As per the Copyright Act, protection is only granted to works of human authorship. AI-generated content, as it stands, does not meet this criterion, making it *ineligible for copyright protection*.
2. **Inputs and AI-generated outputs:** If a human author provides inputs (e.g., prompts) to an AI system, the copyright protection may apply to the *human-authored input*, but not to the AI-generated output. The AI output is considered a product of the machine, not the human.
3. **Compilations and derivative works:** If an AI-generated work is part of a larger compilation or a derivative work created by a human author, copyright protection may extend to the compilation or derivative work, but it will not cover the AI-generated content within it.
4. **Registering AI-generated works:** For registering a work that includes AI-generated content, applicants must specifically identify the AI-generated material and disclaim copyright protection for it. The U.S. Copyright Office may add an annotation to the registration certificate to clarify the scope of the claim.
5. **Supplementary registration:** If a work has already been registered and is later found to include AI-generated material, a supplementary registration can be filed to correct the information on the original registration certificate.

It is important to clarify however that, in some cases, a work containing AI-generated material also contains sufficient human authorship to support a copyright claim. For example, a human may select or arrange AI-generated material in a sufficiently creative way that “the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship.” Or an artist may modify material originally generated by AI technology to such a degree that the modifications meet the standard for copyright protection.

But whom I contract with is afraid to use it.

""We’re concerned about using AI for game assets because of two reasons. We don’t want to rip off artists because of idealistic concerns. We also don’t want to face any repercussions. At this point, basing a commercial enterprise on AI assets portends legal disaster. The implications for the creative community are utterly mind-boggling.

I'm currently paying an artist to produce artwork for my novel, and this is literally the only reason I haven't dumped him in favor of AI art.

Not only is the AI much cheaper, but the results often look BETTER than what the artist makes (and note that I'm using a fairly talented artist). But the problem, is that the stuff AI makes isn't useful for my purpose because of the lack of consistency. As of right now, this is the ONLY thing that's keeping real artists relevant in my opinion.

How long do you think it will be before we can produce not merely individual images, but entire pages and panels featuring the same cast of characters, the same style, etc?

621,midjourney,12j9vq2,AI Youtuber Rant,"So, I've been doing youtube for AI images for about a month now.  I started out doing some marvel mashups because I thought that it's something I thought was interesting and MJ was really good at doing it.  But after a while, I thought that having nothing but marvel/dc mashups became corny and repetitive.  I wanted to show more of MJ's capabilities while staying within a pop culture niche.  For my shorts, I'm about 50/50 over 1k/below 1k views with a fair amount of likes.  I recently started doing videos and they aren't doing well (or as well as I'd like).  

Now here's the problem.  I started looking around at a lot of people in my general niche.  And all of them are doing nothing but marvel/dc mashups.  Like literally 10 videos in a row about how ""What if marvel characters were samurai?"" from one person.  And don't even start with me with the hundreds of ""I wouldn't be batman... if it wasn't Balenciaga"" videos.  And guess what?  They have over 2k views each.  I literally saw a video on youtube that was posted about 2 weeks ago that's subject was; ""What if DC characters were lions?""  And they've got over 2k views.

Now, I know I sound like I'm complaining, but am I wrong to have content that's more creative than they typical ""What if marvel and dc comics superheroes all got ironman armor?""  Should I just cave and do clickbait?  Of course, I'm chasing some kind of clout being on youtube.  That's a gimme.  But I'm at a point where I think I should give up on my integrity.

622,midjourney,132iyti,Best components for a good prompt?,"Hey all, wondering what people have come up with through experimentation as the best ingredients for a good prompt. Thought I'd share the following as an approach.  


Used the /describe feature in MJ to get prompts for art I was interested in replicating.

I want you to seperate parts of the prompts into themes or types:  <*the four prompts>*"".  


At a high level it spat out:  
Subject Matter: This is the main focus of the image, usually describing characters, objects or scenes.

Artistic Style: This specifies the artistic approach or technique for creating the image.

Background/Environment: This describes the setting or context for the subject matter.

Aesthetic or Visual Themes: These are the visual elements, color schemes or motifs used in the image.

Aspect Ratio: This refers to the dimensions of the image, usually represented by width:height.  


Using this structure seems to have helped with better out put. Thinking you could also use it as a priming prompt in GPT to help spit out better prompts.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is the prompts provided for an image I created with midjourney. 

What grinds my gears:

\- How it pulls artists out of a hat. In this case - none of those artists were referenced when I created the image. And the artists referenced are completely different from its own prompts it suggests. 

\- Totally random non-sense like **20122014.**

\- Endless steam of random 'core' descriptors. Not terrible in this example, but in other it is a lot more ridiculous.

\- Descriptors of scenes that are totally wrong ""men watching each other"" -  no one even has their eyes open in the image.

&#x200B;

a painted group of people trying to touch each other, in the style of **ross tran**, cyclorama, dark reflections, layered gestures, pensive stillness, **tyler walpole**, **simon birch** \--ar 3:2

a painting of a man with his arm in the air, in the style of **ross tran**, distorted bodies, ballet academia, **sam spratt**, reflections and mirroring, chiaroscuro portraitures, close up --ar 3:2

the painting is of **men watching each other** on the canvas, in the style of ethereal portraiture, dark navy and light maroon, lively movement portrayal, **honeycore**, hyper-realistic water, pensive poses, luminous palette --ar 3:2

black and white oil on canvas, **20122014**, in the style of acrobatic self-portraits, dark teal and light maroon, lively group compositions, multiple exposure, transfixing marine scenes, serene faces, realistic hyper-detail --ar 3:2

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Another post demonstrated some pretty strong results with describe by using the most well known paintings in history as inputs.

I wish midjourney would provide some kind of description of how it is actually generating this text.

&#x200B;

And how the model works in general. I feel like the total blackbox result is resulting in a community with fairly shallow experience / knowledge and there is no feedback loop 

A lot of influencers seems to gain traction by hyping every feature up as much as possible. And it is crowding out any kind of serious discussion about the tool.

637,aiwars,139g0na,"For those who hold a negative stance toward AI, I would like to pose a question to you. Would you still consider someone an artist if they have been creating art for years, but have recently incorporated AI into their creative process?","Edit: I know the percentage of anti-AI people is low and that the average person is neutral or positive toward AI art. I'm just curious to see what anti-AI people think.

I know this is a bit long, but hopefully, this helps people understand how AI could be used as a tool and assist you in making your art. You could also make beautiful concepts with AI and actually make them have ""emotion"" and ""soul"", as most anti-ai people don't like to believe.

So, I've been creating art for years since when I was in my teens as a means to heal from my childhood trauma, and now as a hobby. I usually like to make photobashed art using Photoshop/Illustrator. I've only recently gotten into creating AI art after being against it for a good year. I wasn’t able to create art for a good while, at least 2 years, because I work as a vaccine developer as my day job so my time has become very limited. Trust me when I say it was starting to make me depressed because I create art as a way to relax and calm myself from my anxieties/depression. Not being able to create anything for at least 2 years was really making me question whether or not I loved my job and if I should even work there because not being able to make art was affecting my mental health.

My journey with Photoshop/Illustrator started when I was creating 3D clothing for my simulation games and learned how to use it to create textures for my models. As I became more skilled, I realized that I could use these skills to create art. I began with a piece called ""Chained Memories,"" which was a combination of 3D modeling and editing in Photoshop/Illustrator. From there, I learned how to photobash using Photoshop/Illustrator to create unique pieces.

I started reading more about AI and decided to give it a try, and honestly, I was in awe. I would use my old art and sketches as references to train my AI, and it was able to get down my vision exactly like I imagined it in my head, and not only that, but it would sometimes give me variations and lead me to a whole new path from what I originally wanted to create. Now, I use AI as a tool to assist me in my creative process. I'm not the type to generate pictures and just slap my name on it. I still spend 10+ hours on my pieces.

My boyfriend is a traditional artist who paints with his hands and was also against the usage of AI for a good while as well, until I convinced him to experiment with using AI with me. He too saw the possibilities and how it could help him. For him, he uses it whenever he feels like he has artist's block and has a hard time putting his ideas together to create a cohesive piece. He doesn't paint exactly what the AI gives him, but it will give him new ideas and help him figure out how to better organize all the shapes, characters, etc. to create a cohesive painting.

After putting a lot of time and effort into editing, my final product may look vastly different from the AI-generated images that served as my inspiration. However, like any other form of art, people can find inspiration in the work of others and create their own pieces based on that style. Although the resulting artwork may have differences, you can still see the influence of the original artist. For instance, I have a deep admiration for Monet and Klimt, and I find that AI is particularly effective at creating impressionist art due to the random patterns it generates.

I believe you still need skills in order to use AI efficiently because text2image is not very good at putting ideas together, in my opinion, or at least my ideas. I have to input my own sketches as references in order for it to finally give me something that I want and am able to work with. Previously, it was commonplace for individuals to acknowledge the influence of certain artists in others' work. However, with the rise of AI, if an image resembles the style of another artist, people are quick to accuse it of theft, disregarding the fact that it is only the style that appears similar.

Imagine, if you will, a handmade painting of an elephant in the style of the great Van Gogh, resembling his iconic Starry Night, and it looks like Van Gogh could've probably painted it himself. However, it must be noted that Van Gogh has never portrayed an elephant in his unique style. In such a scenario, would the creation of the elephant piece be deemed theft? It is important to recognize that this unique creation of the elephant would not have come to existence without the artist's contribution and innovation.

A quick summary of an example of how I've recently started making my art with the assistance of AI:

1. First, I input my old art or my rough sketches into the program and use simpler prompts and fewer steps to generate the image to save time on computation. I prioritize quantity over quality and choose the desired color and style later.
2. Since the generated image is close to what I want, but of course since it's AI, the facial features are rough, and there tends to be an extra hand or oddly shaped hands, that I can't remove with prompt tweaking alone. So, I then take the image to Photoshop for the first round of touch-ups and add/remove details.
3. With the overall composition confirmed, I continue adjusting the prompts while testing different models. Since different models excel in different areas, I need to try multiple options before finding the one that can provide more intricate details for the current image. I increase the number of steps and resolution for more detailed results, which takes more time, so I usually run several images at once while doing something else.
4. Then, I switch between 2-4 different variations, adjusting their weights until I find the desired facial features and shape. I can make adjustments to the model at the same time in Photoshop or Illustrator, or I can finalize the model first and then fine-tune it.
5. Once everything is completely finished, I like to go over it using neural filters and correct my picture using ""camera raw filter"" in Photoshop without any further AI generation. From this point on, it's just my own skills in Photoshop/Illustrator. I will add/change details such as changing colors, adding/removing patterns, adding aspects to the background, adding emotion to the piece by adding emotion to my characters' faces, fixing the hands, feet, face, etc. by drawing in my own hands, face, feet, fingers, toes, etc.
6. Finally, once all the changes are complete and the image looks cohesive. I will go in for a last round of final touches, such as lighting, shading, highlights, etc.

Also, those who believe that AI can't be used to make concept art because of the generated randomness is wrong. That's all I ever create: concept art. All of my art has meaning. For example [https://ibb.co/9Y1wzCY](https://ibb.co/9Y1wzCY)

The picture on the left is the AI-generated image I created using my sketch as a reference and used the generated image as my inspiration. The one on the right is my final product. For the concept of this piece, I wanted to create science art representing DNA and the connection of life on earth, and how DNA is the base of life. The inspiration for the clear globe and the mountains on the bottom was a snow globe. I wanted a way to include the earth or represent the earth but I didn’t want to be too literal and add planet earth. So I decided to metaphorically represent the earth with the clear globe with many plants and butterflies. The DNA is made of flowers and my inspiration for this was “the tree of life”. I included the moon to let my audience know that the sphere surrounded by flowers and butterflies is supposed to represent the Earth. I used mountains as a holder for my “snow globe” to further insinuate that the picture represents the earth and life on earth.",28,14,0.8,2023-05-06 10:41:36,,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/139g0na/for_those_who_hold_a_negative_stance_toward_ai_i/,Boshokie,1381

With art, video design or music production. For me, this argument feels like an extension of ‘digitally designed’ music debate between instrumentalists and computer-based musicians. 

AI supported musicians are a different ball game altogether. This would involve music and art being generated by AI, and likely informed by many existing artists but otherwise unique and therefore in a position to be popular as a unique, albeit fictitious, artist. The royalties would likely go to whomever ran the programme and subsequently bought the rights to the produced works.

Now here is the AI art community who's come into the space of (mostly) the art discord server. They see the digital channel and post content in it...and then the bloodshed starts.

Why is there discord when both digital and AI art are both 'digital' mediums of art?

As I've listed in the channel examples, mediums are segregated within the art community based on tools and processes and combinations of a lot of things. But notice that all of the mediums that fall under the art community involve creating something by drawing a piece of art by hand. Photography does not draw anything by hand, so it is its own community, but is no less creative than what falls under the art community. Personally, I also don't think AI art is any less creative (though I acknowledge all the issues going around it), but I still believe that it falls under it's own category separate from the current 'digital' art medium.

But why? Aren't they all 'digital'? Isn't art and photography just 'art'?  Well, this is where the Artist Mindset comes in.

This way of thinking, generalizing all of these mediums into a single word to describe everything is true **outside of the artist community**, but they matter **within** the community. Painters won't just generalize a photo as a painting and vice-versa. This is why a lot of the current digital artists also react negatively to AI art being passed off as 'digital' art. It is a different type of tool and a different process. The current digital art space have artists work on their art majority by hand. AI does not.

This is my own hot take, but if the AI art community wants to integrate itself within the current art space, they need to understand and accept that their is in fact an 'Artist Mindset' within the art community. You call your AI art 'art', which means you are saying you are in the art space now. Start thinking like an artist if you want to be acknowledged as one, and stop passing off your AI art as 'digital' art. Understand some of the rules and don't just ignore everything that has been established before. They are two different mediums. It may not solve anything, but I think it's still important.

PS: Regarding the 'this is art theft' and the 'this is transformative work' debate, there is already enough discussion going around about that so this post isn't about it.

It doesn't paint a very nice picture of people who defend AI art if they have no human decency and no insight into the process of making art.

Using the likeness would be specifying their name in a prompt to fish out a style which I assume you're all aware works, or using a checkpoint or LoRA or embedding or whatever additional methods there are to achieve a particular style of art.

654,singularity,12gvfsl,There is no Art without choice. The title of 'AI artist' is complete nonsense (for now?),"When an artist creates a work, every aspect of said work has purpose and intent behind it. Whenever you see a drawing, painting, woodcarving, sculpture etc, every minute detail has been placed with intent. The patterns on the floor, the color of the pebbles, the hue of the sky. Digital artists may not have created the brushes that they are using on their pictures, but at least they *chose* them. Even their mistakes are made from *their* choices. ""*But what about photographs?*"" Well  photographers  *choose* what goes into their pictures. ""*Well they can't get rid of annoying details in the background!*"" Yeah but they had the choice to let these details get in the background.

Whenever people use an AI generated imagery software, they only know the big picture. They know the subject, object and action. Maybe the background. But they don't know what the minute details are going to be like. They just have to wait for the AI to give them something.  ""*Well artists aren't able to get everything that they want on their work either!*"" Yeah but the crude substitutes or approximations depicted are their *choices. 3*D artists chose the shitty fog in the orginal Silent Hill, musicians in the 80s chose the notes from their limited  arsenal of sounds, Visual and Sound Effect Artists choose the different sounds and tricks to combine to make outerwordly effects. But what does the 'AI artist' choose exactly? Nothing. Unless they ask for the picture of someone famous or sub in their image (somehow) they can't even choose what the subjects look like.

If people wanna make pretty pictures or even fun re-imagining of current concepts, that is cool and all. Maybe in the future as AI becomes more advanced, we will reach a point where we get images that fit the vision of a person. But until the people using A.I using these pictures can answer the question ""Why did you *choose* to make \[insert any detail\] look like this"", they are not the artist. They just commissioned it.

I 've read some of the debate around AI generated images, and it always misses the point where the AI art exists BECAUSE artists did something before. What will it become when there will be no artists? 

Some art students give up on their studies because they feel inferior (in light, body proportions, ideas etc). I wonder if the job will even exist in the future. It takes a whole youth to create your own style, and now we can just type ""in a Moebius style"" in the prompt and voilà. But in the future, AI could generate original styles. So there's no point for an artist to do a job that can be made in 5 min, and better, also there will be no money for him. (And I disagree with the fact that art is the idea, not the rendering, if it was that, philosophers would be considered as artists). 

Some of you say artists react violently to that evolution. Please walk a mile in their shoes. Yes AI is theft, and not just because it steals from individuals, but because it steals from human. AI needs humans. It CAN'T exist without the work of artists. My point is that when artist will no longer exist, we will just depends on the machine and the stock from History.

**One Artist With One Role** (OAWOR, pronounced Oar) - every single creative endeavor will have one artist listed for each creative element. So a movie, for example, would have several. We can base it on what people do currently. So a modern, pre-AI movie would have screewnwriter, director, cinematrogrpher, actors, etc. going forward, each movie would have these elements no matter if the movie is made the ""old fashioned"" way of pointing a camera at one or more people 'acting' or it is created using these new AI tools. For now, each person will get the same amount of negotiated compensation for these rolls.

Additionally, we'll add a role when it becomes necessary: the role of AI. When / if AI reaches the level where society (and not the government or other 'experts') considers it sentient, compensation will be given to the AI being utilized to generate the content on a percentage basis. So if a movie is 75% AI-generated, the AI entity involved would get that z negotiated amount in return as compensation.

674,artificial,12puy91,Artists won't lose their jobs – my take on AI in arts,"Artists won't lose their jobs. We won't read generated novels, listen generated music or worship paintings made by robot. 

In 1967, Roland Barthes challenged the idea that the author was the most important aspect of a work of art in his influential essay ""The Death of the Author"". Instead, he argued that the art itself and the structure in which it was created were more significant. However, in the 55 years since the essay was published, the importance of the artist has been reaffirmed in a different way.

Today, we not only ask if art is made by humans but also if it's made by artificial intelligence. This question is significant because it reveals what humans value. Humans have a natural inclination to appreciate art made by other humans, and while we don't have a satisfying definition of what art is, we know that it holds social importance (even the most influential George Dickie's institutional definition is determined socially).

To understand the value of human-made art, we can compare it to sports. Even though robots may be faster, more precise, and stronger, we still compare sports achievements among humans. In the same way, AI-generated art will likely have its own category that replaces some marketing aesthetics and products, such as stock photos and low-effort graphics. It may even be used as a tool for creating new forms of art.

However, AI-generated art will not make human artists obsolete. People will lose interest if they realize that a particular piece of music or image was created by AI. As Denis Dutton stated in his essay ""Artistic Crimes"" about art forgery, a painting that is similar to the Mona Lisa may be celebrated and valued as a Da Vinci masterpiece, but if it's discovered to be a forgery, all the former glory will be gone. This is because the forger created the art in a different context, with less effort and without the same level of creativity and skill as the original artist.

AI-generated art will have its own place in the art world, but it will not replace the value and appreciation of human-made art.",12,2,0.56,2023-04-17 23:08:58,Ethics,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/12puy91/artists_wont_lose_their_jobs_my_take_on_ai_in_arts/,TheTristo,350
677,aiwars,12ku0mf,"Why AI art isn't (yet) ""art"" and why artists who use AI art software are no less artists","Just looking for a pretty picture? TL;DR: https://i.imgur.com/YsArMi8.png

Want a summary of this argument? TL;DR: AI art models aren't (yet) artists because they don't convey their own abstract or symbolic concepts, only that of the prompter. But in the future (perhaps today depending on how you feel about the example below) they could be, by deciding what sorts of ideas should be conveyed and generating their own prompting.

## What Is ""Art""?

There are as many definitions of the word ""art"" as there are of other ill-defined terms like ""religion"" or ""love"". But I'm going to lean on a very technical definition of the role that art serves in this post:

> art *n.* any expression through some medium (be it language, behavior or a physical creation) that serves to communicate a symbolic or abstract concept, state of mind, feeling or experience to an intended audience.

So there are a few key points there. For example, this post isn't ""art"" by this definition because it isn't communicating a ""symbolic or abstract concept,"" instead it's communicating a literal and concrete set of concepts.

## Are Models Artists?

So what about AI art models? These take in a prompt and map that prompt to an image. So it makes sense to try to argue that it's meeting the definition. It's taking an abstract concept represented by a prompt and producing an expression of it in visual form.

That's misleading. The process there is simply translation. There's no expression being communicated that wasn't already present. Similarly, a security camera that captures a 2D image of a sculpture in a museum isn't art either, even though the image might convey the same concepts as the sculpture. That's because the ""art"" in question is the sculpture and how you view it is irrelevant.

In AI art programs, the art is the prompt. That's what contains the symbolic or abstract concept that the artist (the human) wishes to convey. Translation to an image is not the artistic component, even though it involves the use of artistic *techniques*.

## How Can Models Become Artists?

The question of where the symbolic or abstract ideas come from is difficult. Is a person who makes a drawing of a character from anime creating ""art"" or are they just translating from one medium to another? There's no one-size-fits-all answer there. Some people inject their own ideas into that process and thus meet the criteria. Some people trace over an existing still from media which you could argue both ways: perhaps they are trying to convey the feeling they experienced when watching that media, and the artistic element was the selection of a particular still that conveyed that meaning. Maybe they're just acting very mechanically to produce what their audience wants.

So a model that takes in a prompt and produces an image through a partially random and partially mechanical process of mapping the prompt to a mathematical space of images isn't art by this definition, but the output is art in the sense that it conveys the source art, the prompt. What if the AI produced the prompt?

As an example, I asked ChatGPT to produce a prompt, but instead of asking for a prompt for a specific idea, I asked, ""Could you produce a prompt for an AI art program such as Stable Diffusion that conveys your symbolic or abstract ideas?"" Its response was:

> Create an abstract representation of the concept of ""infinity."" Use a palette of blues and purples to evoke a sense of depth and vastness. Incorporate geometric shapes that repeat and overlap in a never-ending pattern to symbolize the infinite nature of the concept. Experiment with different levels of transparency and opacity to create a sense of layers and complexity. Finally, include a focal point in the center of the composition that represents the ultimate endpoint of the infinite cycle, but also the beginning of the next iteration.

When given to Stable Diffusion (using the base 1.5 model) it generated [this image](https://i.imgur.com/YsArMi8.png). This image did not come from me. I didn't specify anything about it other than the requirement that it must convey a symbolic or abstract idea. So it's art?

Certainly I'd say that if the AI decides, unprompted, to produce something like this, that it counts as art. But we could view this particular prompt as just an ""average"" response to the sort of question I asked.

I think that this is firmly in the middle of the road. It's not ""clearly art"" but it's also not possible to say that it's not, definitively.

## Human Artists

No matter what, the people who use AI art programs to convey their own symbolic or abstract ideas, no matter how primitive or refined those ideas might be, are artists. They are doing the thing we've defined above as art.

This becomes even more true when we talk about more sophisticated workflows than simply prompting an AI model. AI artists often have long and complex workflows that involve sketching, prompting, refining and iterating, prompt interrogation, pose / scene control, inpaiting, and the use of non-AI tools at several of these stages. All of these activities are in service of the human artist's desire to convey symbolic or abstract ideas to their audience.

## Conclusion

AI image generation models today are not artists. They are tools that artists can use. AI in the future (or perhaps current AI text generation models in conjunction with AI image generators) could be considered artists, but the jury is still out on when that will happen.

No matter what, we cannot deny that the artist who happens to use AI tools in the conveyance of a symbolic or abstract concept is just as much an artist as one who uses paint or photography or prose or collage.",18,0,0.5,2023-04-13 19:04:34,,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/12ku0mf/why_ai_art_isnt_yet_art_and_why_artists_who_use/,Tyler_Zoro,942

705,ArtificialInteligence,12sh02k,AI Art will not replace a fine artists career. It will make it more valuable.,"For the record, I wanted to put my thoughts out there to ease concerns for those worried that AI art will be the demise of a fine artist's career. Those that believe this have not thought it through. 

As AI develops, and the hoopla around it starts to congeal and subsequently subside, AI art will be seen more clearly for what it truly is, and what it truly isn't. 

What I mean by this is not that AI art won't be amazing, and creative, and truly groundbreaking, and appreciated by some, but that it will always lack ""soul"" that comes from human craftsmanship. 

For example, much in the same way that many still seek out hand-crafted mechanical watches created by human hands versus mass-produced digital watches, or a hand-crafted pair of fine leather shoes from Italy. etc., etc., Okay. So you might not be interested in those things, and therefore hard to relate, but I think you get the bigger picture of what I'm saying. In other words, ""craftsmanship"" will never go out of style or go away.

As AI art starts flooding the art scene, the elite art connoisseur and true collector is going to seek out works created by real artist hands and tools. AI Art will only make real world art more scarce, coveted, and valuable. 

To be competitive fine artist will need to come out of the shadows, per se, and demonstrate and showcase their skill and talent either through videos, live demos, or art shows. Their talent, as much as the piece itself will be just as important, and maybe more. The ones who can make a name for themselves in the real-world art space will become highly sought after. 

The question remains - Will AI take market share away from creative people and artists? Yes. But in certain areas but not all. And certainly in the fine art space it will garner buyers who appreciate that style but will not be the demise of a traditional, fine artist career. 

AI art will just become another medium. That's all! 

If there has ever been a time in history where learning how to draw, paint, sculpt, build, etc., has been a more valuable asset or talent to possess, is right here, right now. This is the dawning of a new era for those who possess real-world artistic skills, or willing to learn. Such skills and talents will be valuable and sought after in the years to come. 

One last thing I'll mention. Honing the creative side of your brain will only serve you well in all areas of your life including the business world. 

Creativity plays a significant role in the business world for the following reasons:

1.  Innovation: Creative ideas often result in innovative and unique  solutions to challenges in the business environment. They spark new  products, services, and processes.

2. Competitiveness: Companies that encourage creative thinking and innovation can stay ahead of the  competition by continuously improving their products and services, reaching new markets or streamlining processes.

3. Productivity:  Creative employees tend to be more engaged and motivated, which can lead  to higher productivity and performance.

4. Branding: Creative marketing campaigns can make a brand stand out from competitors, build  brand awareness and consumer loyalty, and create a memorable impression  in the minds of consumers.

5. Problem-Solving: In highly  competitive industries, businesses must develop new ways of  problem-solving. Creativity can help identify unique solutions that  traditional methods may have missed.

6. Adaptation to change:  Creative thinking allows businesses to adapt to changes in the market,  technology, or customer preferences.

Overall, creativity allows businesses to stay relevant by continuously evolving and improving. It is an essential tool for growth. Businesses that foster a culture of creativity can achieve long-term success.

724,sdforall,12pyph6,AI-Generated Art: Impact and Integration in the Artistic Community,"Hey fellow Redditors! I hope you're having a great day so far. I wanted to talk about a subject that has been garnering a lot of attention recently - AI-generated art and its impact on the art community. As I'm sure many of you are aware, AI has become a significant part of our daily lives and is now playing a rapidly increasing role in the world of digital art as well.

While browsing through various art-related subreddits, I've come across an increasing number of AI-generated art pieces being shared. Some of these creations are absolutely mind-blowing, and their detail and creativity has sparked numerous discussions about the ethical implications and potential problems that AI-generated art may pose to the artistic community.

To help us better understand the issue, I've been working on a project to compile a comprehensive list of art-related subreddits and their stance on AI art moderation. With this list, I hope to create an open resource for fellow Reddit users that can be integrated into projects or used in a manner that best suits your needs. Importantly though, brigading or harassing other subreddits is against Reddit's content policies, which I firmly stand against, as I believe in fostering positive dialogue and understanding.

In order to keep the list up-to-date and accurate, I would like to invite community members to submit new information about subreddits through a Google Form that I've created. The latest version of the list can always be found on the webpage as well as in XLSX and CSV formats. Please feel welcome to use and contribute to this resource.

One question that I find particularly interesting about AI-generated art is how we should approach its integration within the artistic community. Does AI-generated art threaten traditional art forms or can it be seen as an exciting new medium that pushes the boundaries of creativity? I am eager to hear your thoughts and engage in a thoughtful conversation.

740,selfpublish,13dd2pe,What would count as satisfactory evidence a cover artist isn't using AI?,"I'm an author as well as a cover artist, so I've never had to hire a cover artist before. Figured I would ask here.

There are enough artists who are just pumping images out with Midjourney and then not disclosing it when they sell a cover that I absolutely understand why authors are wary right now. At the same time, though, some artists are saying you shouldn't buy a cover from someone unless they can stream or record the cover's creation from start to finish and show a video as evidence.

But I don't love that idea.

Like many artists, I'm neurodivergent and multitask while I make art. I'm all over the place. I seriously struggle with sitting down and focusing on a specific task. I feel like expecting every artist to be able to stream or record a video for every cover is kind of... ablest. One video, sure, that would be possible with a ton of editing. But every cover? That would add so much work. I know I would have to raise my prices pretty significantly to make up for it.

Some of the cover artists I've spoken with are concerned with publicizing their techniques and workflows and other artists replicating it to compete with them, too, which is a whole other issue.

A significant portion of my work involves 3D models and paintovers/photomanip, so I've offered to show wireframes to show they're legitimate models, but the response has generally been that authors don't often know how 3D models work, so it doesn't prove anything. Same with PSDs with tons of layers.

I would love to have a conversation about this because I'm stressing out.

As an author, what would you accept as satisfactory evidence a cover artist isn't using AI?

\-

**Edit #1**: Oh, I forgot to mention there are no AI detectors that are accurate enough to use, unfortunately. All of them regularly give false positives and false negatives. I've tested them out to see if that's an option.

**Edit #2:** I really don't want this to become an AI debate. If an author doesn't care about AI, that's one thing, but if they want to avoid it and they want proof a cover artist isn't using it, I'm just wondering if we can agree on something other than ""show a video of every cover"" (which isn't feasible for many neurodivergent artists).

746,ArtistLounge,13c1qk6,AI art has ruined Art Station,"I used to love this site. I've logged in almost daily since I took upon myself becoming an artist, specifically concept artist or illustrator. It used to be an amazing site, where you could see the pros and aspiring artist grow, and get tons of inspiration and ideas. That is all gone now.

Now I enter the site, and the first thing i see is a big square with a clearly AI generated generic pretty anime/stylized girl, which suspiciously looks like the style of an already stablished artist, but strangely enough, its not the artist himself who posted this? 

Next thing you realize, people are selling AI generated reference and other stuff, which i find mind boggling, but even more so that there are people that buy it. And even more mind/boggling so that a site as big as Art Station allows this.

Best of all, they claim to have taken ""measures"" against ai art to ""protect"" artists. What a bombastic, huge, humoungous amount of crap. i don't know what exactly happened, but there is probably some suitcase passing behind the scenes. This ""measure"" is putting a check box in the filters, which you will have to look hard for it, because it's at the bottommost of the list. Only the decision to put it there says a lot. People made this page, nothing is placed somewhere out of randomness or laziness.

And this doesnt even filter out a lot of the ai generated content, because the artist himself has to state the fact that he used it in the program list. Which AI artist in their sane mind would put it there?? It's like automatically blacklisting yourself. This measure is beyond useless.

The part that makes me sad the most, is that now i just don't go to this site anymore. It's practically impossible to tell what is AI generated and what is not. And there are cases of normal artists getting flak for supposedly using it, and viceversa.

ArtStation is the portfolio site. It's ment to gauge the skill of the artists, not blow up like instagram or tiktok. It's ment for pros looking for fresh hires and upcoming artists. It's ment to inspire the next generation of artists to create new and amazing styles and ideas.",159,434,0.97,2023-05-08 22:16:41,Digital Art,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/13c1qk6/ai_art_has_ruined_art_station/,FiveWindDragons,374

749,antinatalism2,13d1dz3,AI Is Automating My Passion As An Artist & I’ve Become Even More Antinatalistic Because Of It,"TLDR: AI is replacing my passion as an artist and I believe AI programs are going to plunge us further into a dystopia. I don’t want to live in or bring kids into a world like this.

I’ve divided this up into sections in order to make it easier to read.

**Introduction**

Who am I? I’m a 20 year old lady with mild autism. I am an artist and have known since I was little. I have been working to improve my skills for so many years and am currently in university studying animation. Art and animation are the only things I am really good at. My autism makes life mostly unenjoyable. My art has been the one thing keeping me going all these years.

**The Problem**

You have all definitely heard of AI art generators by now. I was shocked when Dall-E 2 was unveiled in April last year. We all thought AI could never be creative or make art. Yet all these creative AI’s pretty much came out of nowhere in quick succession last year. Mid journey, chatgpt, stable diffusion, text to video programs, you name it. It just happened all at once.

My concerns should be obvious. These AI systems can make art and even write stories. They can do it at lightning speed and at the cost of electricity. This puts anyone who writes or draws for a living in a terrible position. Companies and individuals will surely go for the quicker, cheaper option. Even if it is slightly worse in quality. 

My autism would make getting any other job an actual nightmare so I have been incredibly disheartened by these developments. Not to mention that many creatives are like me and are on the spectrum too. They are often socially awkward and find regular life difficult. Many of them will have their entire future’s ruined by these systems.

I still find it hard to believe that art of all things is getting automated. Art, writing and more. All the creative tasks are getting taken from us. Sure, they can still be hobbies. But that just leaves us with more soul crushing work. And not to mention that future generations will have it even worse. Why would anyone want to bring kids into such a depressing world where all the things we enjoy are monopolized and automated? I was debating whether I wanted to be a mother. I knew my autism would make it very difficult, but these latest developments have pushed me right into antinatalism. 

**A Dystopian Future**

Not to mention the other, possibly worse side effects of this new technology. AI voices, videos and images are getting better every week. Imagine how easy it will be to generate a fake video of someone doing or saying something horrible that they didn’t do. And the technology will likely be so good in just a few years that we will have no way of knowing if it’s fake or not. Sounds like the worst kind of dystopia. Some people may doubt that the tech will ever get that good. Well we never thought that AI would be able to creat art, yet here we are. Just look at how much AI images have improved since April of last year. Or heck, 3 months ago! 

But back to job/purpose loss. This worries me just as much as the paragraph above. Art is the only thing I have really ever excelled at. And I am now realizing that I probably won’t be able to make it my career. Yes, I do animation so that probably has a while longer. But at the rate the tech is progressing I wouldn’t be surprised if AI takes over animation and VFX in under 10 years.

**Where I’m At**

I am not exaggerating when I say I am crushed. Truly this time though. I have been through many things that destroyed my spirit, it’s pretty much guaranteed for people on the spectrum. I was bullied my entire childhood, denied being able to be in a relationship due to my sensory issues, isolated from society and more. Yet the one thing that kept me hopeful was being able to show the world my art and make a living off it.

And now it’s gone.

Now anyone can have top tier skill. Anyone can generate anything in any style. Even if I make a new style, someone can just feed my drawings into a machine and infinitely clone them. My skill doesn’t matter anymore. The one thing I truly had going for me is basically worthless. And if not now, in a few years. I have no purpose anymore. I feel worthless. Even though I have more friends and family that love me then most people, I feel worthless now. Even if there is still room for human artists, we simply can’t keep up with the speed AI produces stuff. We will be drowned out by AI works.

I knew I would likely never make big bucks by pursuing art and animation. Unless you run a massive studio you don’t get mega rich. But I knew I could earn enough to comfortably live off my work. With things like YouTube and Patreon it seemed feasible as long as I worked to become good enough. I wanted to start doing commissions online. I wasn’t expecting to get rich, but I was so excited and happy to get started. Then this all happened. I already see many artists online talking about how they’ve lost their jobs or how nobody commissions them anymore. 

**How This Ties Back To Antinatalism**

Anti-natalism at its core is about life being meaningless and full of suffering. My life has been harder then the average person’s. I got dealt a shitty deal with being born autistic. Then now I’ve had my one purpose and passion taken from me at the hands of corporate greed.

I have never felt more antinatalistic then I do now. Why should we bring kids into this horrible, artificial world? Where all our most basic human desires are replaced with simulations. Social media, porn, ai girl/boyfriends, ai art, ai stories, it’s all artificial and fake versions of our most primal instincts. I truly believe we are entering a very dark age. One where the wealth inequality gets even worse, passions and dreams are crushed, meaningful relationships are further replaced by simulations.

I cannot understand why anyone would want to have kids anymore. I know I certainly won’t be.

**Questions You May Have**

I want to dedicate a section to answering some questions I can see people having for me as to clear up any confusion. 

“You’re Being Dramatic”

I can see why someone might think that. But imagine if you’re entire purpose and passion suddenly became pretty much worthless and you had to face the rest of your life without it. Seriously, imagine it. You’d be devastated. Also, all the things I’ve mentioned here either already have happened or are likely to happen.

“AI will never be as good as human artists”

Maybe it will never be as good as the top 1% but it’s already better then most artists out there. And if it’s this good now then imagine where it’ll be in 5-10 years. Not to mention that even if it is slightly worse, most people will chose it over a human artist simply due to the speed and cost.

”You Must Adapt And Use The AI’s In Your Workflow”

I will. I will do anything to keep my dream alive. I’ve played around with various AI tools to enhance my workflow. But in doing so, the enjoyment is gone and my original visions destroyed. Not to mention that AI will dramatically devalue all creative works, so I may not be able to earn enough to keep doing art as a career.

“These Are Just New Tools”

Maybe now, but they’re already replacing tons of artists, voice actors and more. Also, the end game for these ‘tools’ is to completely remove the need for any skill or talent. An AI image generator makes all the decisions for you, while you type in a text prompt. These systems are replacements, not tools. If you were a brick layer you wouldn’t see a brick laying machine as a tool. You would see it as a replacement. 

“We Can Fight The Companies Developing These AI’s”

Sure, but what will that achieve? The technology is out there and it won’t go away. Even if every government in the world banned these AI’s overnight then they would still be developed in secret. I know some people are suing AI art generators over copyright infringement for using their art to train the AI’s. I personally do not see the court systems ruling in favor of the artists. It will most likely be seen as fair use. 

“There Will Always Be A Place For Human Made Art”

I do agree on this. One tiny positive is that physical art such as paintings and sculptures may have a resurgence due to digital art being devalued. But this will likely be a tiny niche. 

“This Is Just Like NFT’s”

No it’s not. Everyone knew from the beginning how stupid NFT’s were. We knew they were a pyramid scheme destined to collapse. And they did. AI art and their similar tools  are not something that’s going to go away. They are rapidly developing and getting better. They’re going to be more and more widely used in the future.

”Do You Hate AI Bro’s?”

No. I don’t hate anyone who uses or is excited about this new tech. I can totally see their perspectives and we shouldn’t dogpile them. My issues lie with the developers of this technology and the people online saying “LOL GET REKT ARTISTS! YOU’RE WORTHLESS NOW!”. You’re allowed to love this tech, but actively routing for someone’s downfall is very horrible and childish. I wouldn’t think anything bad of any group of people who were about to have their professions made obsolete. 

**Conclusion**

I am truly broken this time. 

No really, that’s my conclusion. I don’t see this getting better. We are entering into an even bigger dystopia then before. I have never felt more hopeless then I do now. I’m only 20 and I’m tired. My spirit has officially been crushed. And yet I’m meant to stay in this game for another 70+ years.

For the record, no, I will never end my life. As mentioned before, I have far to many people that love me who would be destroyed if I did. But I do know one thing now. Life truly is just endless suffering. We’re all at the mercy of our circumstances. And all of us now just happened to be unlucky enough to be born into the most boring dystopia. I say we spare our unborn children the same fate.

767,singularity,12ywjnl,AI will not destroy art. It will change the scale at which we can express ourselves.,"I keep reading opinions about how art will be dead in the near future (AI writes novels, makes films, designs visual art etc) and I agree with this assessment if we think of human creativity strictly in the terms of currently existing media. 

But what I think is missing in the debate is the change of scale that AI will bring to human creativity. 

What I mean is that we will be able to generate (and share) whole fictional virtual universes. You design and curate the tone, key elements, specific storylines you imagine, locations etc, but the details are filled in by the AI.

Imagine creating a VR representation of GoT, you walk in a library in King's landing and grab a random book of a shelf, by the time you open the book it has been written by the AI in a way that stays true to the fictional universe of GoT. In this scenario George RR Martin would have been the architect/seeder of the universe and the AI just fills in all the gaps as best it can (and expands beyond the original story).

So writing novels, painting, movie making etc will possibly be a niche hobby, while the true vanguard of art will be on a complete different scale. 

(On top of that you might have millennia to explore/create/share these endless fictional universes. And that's assuming you stay more or less human, but that's a different topic altogether)",190,394,0.87,2023-04-26 00:23:21,AI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/12ywjnl/ai_will_not_destroy_art_it_will_change_the_scale/,Professional-Gap-243,239

796,antinatalism,13d1c26,AI Is Replacing My Passion As An Artist & I’ve Never Been More Antinatalistic,"TLDR: AI is replacing my passion as an artist and I believe AI programs are going to plunge us further into a dystopia. I don’t want to live in or bring kids into a world like this.

I’ve divided this up into sections in order to make it easier to read.

**Introduction**

Who am I? I’m a 20 year old lady with mild autism. I am an artist and have known since I was little. I have been working to improve my skills for so many years and am currently in university studying animation. Art and animation are the only things I am really good at. My autism makes life mostly unenjoyable. My art has been the one thing keeping me going all these years.

**The Problem**

You have all definitely heard of AI art generators by now. I was shocked when Dall-E 2 was unveiled in April last year. We all thought AI could never be creative or make art. Yet all these creative AI’s pretty much came out of nowhere in quick succession last year. Mid journey, chatgpt, stable diffusion, text to video programs, you name it. It just happened all at once.

My concerns should be obvious. These AI systems can make art and even write stories. They can do it at lightning speed and at the cost of electricity. This puts anyone who writes or draws for a living in a terrible position. Companies and individuals will surely go for the quicker, cheaper option. Even if it is slightly worse in quality. 

My autism would make getting any other job an actual nightmare so I have been incredibly disheartened by these developments. Not to mention that many creatives are like me and are on the spectrum too. They are often socially awkward and find regular life difficult. Many of them will have their entire future’s ruined by these systems.

I still find it hard to believe that art of all things is getting automated. Art, writing and more. All the creative tasks are getting taken from us. Sure, they can still be hobbies. But that just leaves us with more soul crushing work. And not to mention that future generations will have it even worse. Why would anyone want to bring kids into such a depressing world where all the things we enjoy are monopolized and automated? I was debating whether I wanted to be a mother. I knew my autism would make it very difficult, but these latest developments have pushed me right into antinatalism. 

**A Dystopian Future**

Not to mention the other, possibly worse side effects of this new technology. AI voices, videos and images are getting better every week. Imagine how easy it will be to generate a fake video of someone doing or saying something horrible that they didn’t do. And the technology will likely be so good in just a few years that we will have no way of knowing if it’s fake or not. Sounds like the worst kind of dystopia. Some people may doubt that the tech will ever get that good. Well we never thought that AI would be able to creat art, yet here we are. Just look at how much AI images have improved since April of last year. Or heck, 3 months ago! 

But back to job/purpose loss. This worries me just as much as the paragraph above. Art is the only thing I have really ever excelled at. And I am now realizing that I probably won’t be able to make it my career. Yes, I do animation so that probably has a while longer. But at the rate the tech is progressing I wouldn’t be surprised if AI takes over animation and VFX in under 10 years.

**Where I’m At**

I am not exaggerating when I say I am crushed. Truly this time though. I have been through many things that destroyed my spirit, it’s pretty much guaranteed for people on the spectrum. I was bullied my entire childhood, denied being able to be in a relationship due to my sensory issues, isolated from society and more. Yet the one thing that kept me hopeful was being able to show the world my art and make a living off it.

And now it’s gone.

Now anyone can have top tier skill. Anyone can generate anything in any style. Even if I make a new style, someone can just feed my drawings into a machine and infinitely clone them. My skill doesn’t matter anymore. The one thing I truly had going for me is basically worthless. And if not now, in a few years. I have no purpose anymore. I feel worthless. Even though I have more friends and family that love me then most people, I feel worthless now. Even if there is still room for human artists, we simply can’t keep up with the speed AI produces stuff. We will be drowned out by AI works.

I knew I would likely never make big bucks by pursuing art and animation. Unless you run a massive studio you don’t get mega rich. But I knew I could earn enough to comfortably live off my work. With things like YouTube and Patreon it seemed feasible as long as I worked to become good enough. I wanted to start doing commissions online. I wasn’t expecting to get rich, but I was so excited and happy to get started. Then this all happened. I already see many artists online talking about how they’ve lost their jobs or how nobody commissions them anymore. 

**How This Ties Back To Antinatalism**

Anti-natalism at its core is about life being meaningless and full of suffering. My life has been harder then the average person’s. I got dealt a shitty deal with being born autistic. Then now I’ve had my one purpose and passion taken from me at the hands of corporate greed.

I have never felt more antinatalistic then I do now. Why should we bring kids into this horrible, artificial world? Where all our most basic human desires are replaced with simulations. Social media, porn, ai girl/boyfriends, ai art, ai stories, it’s all artificial and fake versions of our most primal instincts. I truly believe we are entering a very dark age. One where the wealth inequality gets even worse, passions and dreams are crushed, meaningful relationships are further replaced by simulations.

I cannot understand why anyone would want to have kids anymore. I know I certainly won’t be.

**Questions You May Have**

I want to dedicate a section to answering some questions I can see people having for me as to clear up any confusion. 

“You’re Being Dramatic”

I can see why someone might think that. But imagine if you’re entire purpose and passion suddenly became pretty much worthless and you had to face the rest of your life without it. Seriously, imagine it. You’d be devastated. Also, all the things I’ve mentioned here either already have happened or are likely to happen.

“AI will never be as good as human artists”

Maybe it will never be as good as the top 1% but it’s already better then most artists out there. And if it’s this good now then imagine where it’ll be in 5-10 years. Not to mention that even if it is slightly worse, most people will chose it over a human artist simply due to the speed and cost.

”You Must Adapt And Use The AI’s In Your Workflow”

I will. I will do anything to keep my dream alive. I’ve played around with various AI tools to enhance my workflow. But in doing so, the enjoyment is gone and my original visions destroyed. Not to mention that AI will dramatically devalue all creative works, so I may not be able to earn enough to keep doing art as a career.

“These Are Just New Tools”

Maybe now, but they’re already replacing tons of artists, voice actors and more. Also, the end game for these ‘tools’ is to completely remove the need for any skill or talent. An AI image generator makes all the decisions for you, while you type in a text prompt. These systems are replacements, not tools. If you were a brick layer you wouldn’t see a brick laying machine as a tool. You would see it as a replacement. 

“We Can Fight The Companies Developing These AI’s”

Sure, but what will that achieve? The technology is out there and it won’t go away. Even if every government in the world banned these AI’s overnight then they would still be developed in secret. I know some people are suing AI art generators over copyright infringement for using their art to train the AI’s. I personally do not see the court systems ruling in favor of the artists. It will most likely be seen as fair use. 

“There Will Always Be A Place For Human Made Art”

I do agree on this. One tiny positive is that physical art such as paintings and sculptures may have a resurgence due to digital art being devalued. But this will likely be a tiny niche. 

“This Is Just Like NFT’s”

No it’s not. Everyone knew from the beginning how stupid NFT’s were. We knew they were a pyramid scheme destined to collapse. And they did. AI art and their similar tools  are not something that’s going to go away. They are rapidly developing and getting better. They’re going to be more and more widely used in the future.

”Do You Hate AI Bro’s?”

No. I don’t hate anyone who uses or is excited about this new tech. I can totally see their perspectives and we shouldn’t dogpile them. My issues lie with the developers of this technology and the people online saying “LOL GET REKT ARTISTS! YOU’RE WORTHLESS NOW!”. You’re allowed to love this tech, but actively routing for someone’s downfall is very horrible and childish. I wouldn’t think anything bad of any group of people who were about to have their professions made obsolete. 

**Conclusion**

I am truly broken this time. 

No really, that’s my conclusion. I don’t see this getting better. We are entering into an even bigger dystopia then before. I have never felt more hopeless then I do now. I’m only 20 and I’m tired. My spirit has officially been crushed. And yet I’m meant to stay in this game for another 70+ years.

For the record, no, I will never end my life. As mentioned before, I have far to many people that love me who would be destroyed if I did. But I do know one thing now. Life truly is just endless suffering. We’re all at the mercy of our circumstances. And all of us now just happened to be unlucky enough to be born into the most boring dystopia. I say we spare our unborn children the same fate.

831,aiwars,12qxljv,On The Defensiveness of AI Artists,"tl;dr Because we want to feel that small spark of happiness from having created something without being shit on by people we have done no wrong to.

Something I have noticed as an AI art creator and a participant in AI art spaces is that we feel a sense of accomplishment and happiness that comes from having created something that didn't exist before. Even the most basic and simple AI creations can have this effect, particularly for people new to the community or to creative endeavors altogether. As someone who has little traditional skill in visual arts and limited time and talent to learn them, I feel a great deal of satisfaction in creating something that I set out to create. Sure, I can put in 'oil painting of a cat, greg rutkowski' and get something that brings a smile to my face but the real work of getting an image to match what is in my head, even when it is simplified by AI, feels like something real and worth sharing with others.

Much of the anger and defensiveness of the pro-AI community seems to come from being denied these simple pleasures. Some, of course, would take it too far and claim to be on par with a real artist whose skills have taken a lifetime to hone and who possesses a rare natural talent, but most of us aren't seeking that kind of recognition. I have found myself the target of barbed insults and personal attacks for sharing AI art creations that have resulted in real pain and depression, despite my rather tough and resilient ego, and these feelings are the root of extremism and factionalism. I've never sought any recognition as an artist or any money for my creations, all I seek is someone saying 'hey, that looks cool' and I am often treated as though I'm robbing my artistic heroes at gunpoint by people who seem to be lashing out at their helplessness to change the fact that AI art is here to stay and it makes cool images, usually better than what its critics can make. I'm not posting my creations in spaces like ""Hand-Made Paintings"", that would be an obvious problem that would justify a negative response, but in places that allow copy-paste of other peoples art and screenshots of tweets.

Ai art critics, and I would include myself among them in many ways, would do better to address real issues like whether pay services such as Midjourney should be forced to pay the artists whose work they are profiting from or supporting an opt-out for artists who do not want to be included in a pay sites database. We face the real possibility of both sides losing this fight and only mega-corporations being able to benefit from this technology while all commercial artists are replaced by computer simulations that regurgitate previous works.",66,19,0.74,2023-04-18 20:35:33,,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/12qxljv/on_the_defensiveness_of_ai_artists/,mossmanjones,476

835,aiwars,12ns57s,Why are some people so eager to replace non AI artists?,"This is a question about some of the people who are on the side of defending ai, not ai art itself. I believe Ai art will be a powerful new tool and will open doorways for new ways of making art but I don’t see it replacing the truly great artists out there (at least not soon) like Craig Mullins. Personally, I am on the side of hoping that artists who do and do not use AI can coexist the way traditional and digital artists do today.

While I do see most of the pro Ai users out there having reasonable discourse, it seems like there are a quite a few out there who just seem angry at artists as a whole and want to see their field of expertise become obsolete. Let it be clear, I’m not talking about the people who are criticizing some of the ridiculous behavior of certain artists, rather I’m asking about the people who seem to hate artists for being artists.
Now, I understand that when it comes to any controversial topic there will be idiots and screamers on both sides. 
I’m no stranger to artists being unreasonable, emotional and demanding when it comes to the topic of Ai, but at least I understand why— for many it feels like not just their careers, but their hopes and dreams are being taken away in front of their very eyes. 
But what have artists done to these haters to make them so angry? I just don’t get it.

Another somewhat related question is: why are so many people so eager to replace artists and not some of the more mundane hated jobs in the world? I would think replacing people’s creative endeavors would be the last thing you’d want to replace (ex. Ai replaces humans for 95% of the easy, mundane jobs allowing people to pursue their passions, aka careers that involve, novel, interesting, and complex problems that require creativity to solve).",78,16,0.71,2023-04-16 05:40:39,,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/12ns57s/why_are_some_people_so_eager_to_replace_non_ai/,YamammyX,324

2. I think it discourages new artists from learning, by deflating the value of learning these hard-earned skills. Validation and encouragement is important when you're learning, for better or for worse. The sense that technical virtuosity and artistic skill have been automated is deeply discouraging, deeply depressing for people investing the necessary years into honing their talents. When work better than yours can be generated in milliseconds, by the thousands, it makes you think, ""What's the point?"" If no new artists set out on this path, I think we'll only become more creatively bankrupt.

866,DefendingAIArt,137dy51,Surprised by how accepting the older generation is of AI art.,"I'm honestly surprised at how accepting the older generation is of AI art. Most of the hate I get for using AI to make art comes mostly (but not all) from Gen Z, which is even more surprising to me since they're supposed to be the most technological? but many older people have even defended me in posts where I get hate, stating that they're old enough to recall when all art was hand drawn and the furor when other ways to produce them were initiated, and that they don't care how an image is created they just appreciate the talent to utilize what is available to do so. This is very refreshing, and I'm happy to know that older people are more accepting of it because they have seen hate when photography and digital art became forms of making art.

Edit:  I didn't mean the post to sound negative toward older people! I apologize if it came off that way. I was just surprised because of the stereotype about the older generation usually being against technological change. From my experience with the older people I grew up around, they were very much ""technology is going to be the death of us."" So I apologize if my post seemed biased toward older people. I truly respect the older generation and enjoy hearing about their life stories and experiences.

873,aiwars,132d3t6,I don't understand why people are so adamant that nobody have fun. Literally nobody is being harmed by screwing around with AI art programs for personal amusement.,"I'm reposting this here as this is a more open subreddit for debate and discourse on this issue.   


While there are people who do view AI art as a legitimate art form, the vast majority of people who use AI art programs just want screw around with it for nothing more than just personal amusement and funsies. However people on the anti-AI side have become so militant about their views that they think that ALL uses of AI art are morally reprehensible, even if you're not selling it or posting it anywhere.   


I've even seen twitter posts of people comparing AI generated porn to ""digital rape"", which I find disgusting and minimizing of those who have been victims of actual rape or sexual assault.  


People have their own viewson this issue and they're fully entitled to their own opinon. Some people think that only human artists should be in the art world, that's perfectly okay. I don't see the issue with people making funny memes with Stable Diffusion as a joke or whacking it to AI generated big booba anime waifus. Its just people having fun with it. They're not trying to take artists jobs away or ""literally kill people"".",172,11,0.63,2023-04-29 02:26:29,,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/132d3t6/i_dont_understand_why_people_are_so_adamant_that/,PromisedLand22,205
874,dresdenfiles,137k0zo,Community poll: AI Art,"Good morning Dresden fans!  So, recently we've had a couple of instances of Fan Art generated using online artificial intelligence tools.  Concerns have been raised regarding the propriety of this practice - the ""argument against"" is that these online tools scrape art created by a large number of artists who have placed their ""by hand"" art online, and thus the results infringe on the rights of those individuals.

This is a complicated legal issue, and I assume that over time our culture will arrive at some way of handling the situation.  When that happens, we will of course operate the community accordingly.  In the meantime, though, we have to decide what to do - it's not ""obvious"" what the right policy should be in this regard.  

So, we are asking for you, the real ""owners"" of this community, to decide.  If you have an opinion on this issue, please respond to this poll so we can take your wishes into account as we move forward.

We do feel that attempts to use AI art to garner a profit are inappropriate, and we generally don't support profit making ventures using the community for advertising anyway, so this applies to artwork posted in a non-profit way.

Thanks!!!
